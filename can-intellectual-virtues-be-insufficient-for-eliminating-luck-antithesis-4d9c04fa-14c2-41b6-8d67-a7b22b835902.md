## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the elimination of luck in the formation of a true belief. This principle, together with the understanding that intellectual virtues do not necessarily preclude luck, suggests that possessing intellectual virtue may not suffice for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person has an intellectual virtue leading to a belief, but luck still plays a significant role in its truth. Intuitively, this does not align with our understanding of what it means to know something.**
