## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition and this belief has practical consequences. Intuitively, however, there might be factors like accidental correctness or manipulation that prevent this from being knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that mere truth and belief with practical consequences do not cover accidental or manipulated cases. This principle suggests sufficiency conditions for knowledge should prevent such failures.**
