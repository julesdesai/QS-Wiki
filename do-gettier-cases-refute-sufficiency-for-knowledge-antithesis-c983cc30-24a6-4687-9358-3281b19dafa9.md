## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone forms a true belief based on a justified falsehood, often called a Gettier case. In such scenarios, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite having belief, truth, and justification.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge cannot be solely defined by belief, truth, and justification, as typified by Gettier scenarios like the person believing it is noon based on a mismatched but coincidentally correct clock.**
