## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a reliable cognitive process about a very lucky event that turns out to be true. Intuitively, we would not judge this belief to be knowledge because it seems more like a lucky guess.**, **It is implausible that just because a belief is formed through a reliable process, it automatically qualifies as knowledge without considering the context or the content of the belief.**
