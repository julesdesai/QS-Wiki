## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just practical utility of belief. A belief that is only pragmatically beneficial but lacks justification is not knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where someone believes a true proposition solely because it is pragmatically useful, yet lacks any evidence or justification for the belief. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge.**
