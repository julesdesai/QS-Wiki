## Content

**Imagine a situation where a gambler believes they will win the lottery without any sound reasoning, and they incidentally win. Intuitively, we would judge that this gambler does not truly know they would win, even with a true belief and the occurrence of a causal connection after the fact.**, **There is a plausible principle that accidental truth and causation linked post-factum do not suffice for knowledge.**
