## Content

**Consider a scenario where two persons have identical beliefs and mental states, but one has an unreliable cognitive history and the other has a reliable one. Intuitively, we might judge them as having different knowledge statuses.**, **The presence of external reliability generates epistemic inequality despite identical internal states, which seems counterintuitive.**
