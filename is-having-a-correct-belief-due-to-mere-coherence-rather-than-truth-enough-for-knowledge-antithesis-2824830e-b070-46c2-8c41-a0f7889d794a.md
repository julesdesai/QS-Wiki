## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief based solely on a coherent network of interconnected but false beliefs, and the belief happens to be true. Intuitively, despite no defeaters and the belief being true, we would deny knowledge here as truth arose from accidental coherence rather than reliable belief-formation methods.**
