## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person satisfies justification standards in context 1 but not in context 2, and a third context arises requiring reconciliation of the two. Intuitively, this creates a potential regress of ever-shifting standards for justification.**, **A plausible principle is that justification standards should resolve in finite steps, but contextualism risks an indefinite regress of standard qualifications.**
