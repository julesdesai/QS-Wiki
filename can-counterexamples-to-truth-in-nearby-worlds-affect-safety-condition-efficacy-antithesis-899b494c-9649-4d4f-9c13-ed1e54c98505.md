## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person trusts a usually reliable weather forecast predicting rain, and it rains, but only due to an unexpected meteorological anomaly. Intuitively, we would judge that although the forecast was true in this instance, the unusual circumstances challenge the notion that the belief is safe.**, **There is a plausible principle that if specific unexpected factors lead to truth in a particular world, it may not guarantee truth in other nearby possible worlds, thus affecting the efficacy of safety conditions.**
