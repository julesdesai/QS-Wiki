**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief about the number of jellybeans in a jar merely by guessing. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that this person does not genuinely know the number of jellybeans, despite the truth of their belief.**, **An intellectual virtue requires cognitive abilities or skills that reliably lead to truth. Guessing does not involve the exercise of such abilities or skills.**
