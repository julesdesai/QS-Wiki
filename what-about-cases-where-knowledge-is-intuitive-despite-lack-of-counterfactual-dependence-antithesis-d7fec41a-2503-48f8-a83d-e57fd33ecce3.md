## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person correctly solves a complex mathematical problem through sheer intuition without actually following a proof or process. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person might have knowledge.**, **A case in which a belief is true and intuitive without following an explicit intellectual process challenges the necessity of intellectual virtue or competence for knowledge.**, **A belief formed through sheer intuition may not counterfactually depend on the proposition being true, yet it might still be appropriately considered knowledge.**
