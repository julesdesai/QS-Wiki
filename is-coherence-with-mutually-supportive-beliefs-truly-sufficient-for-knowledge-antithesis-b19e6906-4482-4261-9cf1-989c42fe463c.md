## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a false proposition, yet this false proposition coheres with a set of mutually supportive beliefs that include other false propositions. In such a scenario, intuitively, it would be incorrect to say the person knows the proposition because it is false.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth. This principle together with the scenario where a belief is false and coheres with other false beliefs suggests that coherence with mutually supportive beliefs alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
