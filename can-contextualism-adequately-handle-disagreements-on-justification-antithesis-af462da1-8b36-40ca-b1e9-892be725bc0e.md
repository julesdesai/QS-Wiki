## Content

**It is implausible that disagreements on justification standards between contexts can be easily resolved if contexts determine what counts as justification, yet contextualism implies this is likely.**, **Suppose two people from highly different contexts disagree on what justifies a belief in a true proposition. Intuitively, it is unclear who, if either, has knowledge, highlighting a conflict within contextualism.**
