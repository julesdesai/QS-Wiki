## Content

**Consider a case in which a person claims a basic belief that is indistinguishable from an assumption without clear criteria. Intuitively, this lack of distinction challenges the credibility of certain basic beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be basic, it must have criteria distinguishing it from assumptions. This principle together with the indistinct nature of certain claimed basic beliefs questions their foundational status.**
