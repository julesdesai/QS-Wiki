## Content

**Suppose a person believes they left their keys in the car with 99% confidence based on a quick memory check. However, this belief tracks the truth across relevant counterfactual situations. Intuitively, we would judge that such high confidence without further evidence does not suffice for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that high subjective confidence without a strong evidential basis does not amount to knowledge, even if belief tracks the truth.**
