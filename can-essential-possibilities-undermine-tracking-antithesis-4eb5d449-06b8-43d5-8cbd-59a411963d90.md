## Content

**Consider a possibility where a person believes a certain street will be quiet because it is normally so, but unbeknownst to them, a parade is scheduled that would change this under different circumstances. Intuitively, we would judge that their belief does not constitute knowledge, as it fails to track the situation where it would be false.**
