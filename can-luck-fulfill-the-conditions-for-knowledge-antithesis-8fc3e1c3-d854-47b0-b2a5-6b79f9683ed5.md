## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person P guesses the outcome of a coin flip correctly and has a justified belief that matches this true outcome. Intuitively, we have to say that P does not have knowledge even though the belief is true and justified.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must exclude lucky guesses, even if justified and true.**, **A scenario where luck plays a fundamental role violates the sufficiency of belief, truth, and justification for knowledge.**
