## Content

**Suppose a person forms beliefs through a generally reliable weather app that usually provides accurate forecasts. However, due to an internal error, the app occasionally reports sunny weather when it is actually raining. Intuitively, if the app predicts sun but it rains, the belief about sunny weather does not amount to knowledge.**, **Even if a process is generally reliable, it is possible for specific instances of belief formation to be based on misinformation. Knowledge requires that beliefs formed in specific instances are through a reliable process that actually provides truth.**
