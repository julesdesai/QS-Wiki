## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses their intellectual virtues or abilities and generates a belief about a proposition that is true by coincidence or error in their reasoning process. Intuitively, despite the belief being true, we either have to say that they do not possess knowledge or accept flawed reasoning as part of knowledge**, **It is implausible to accept erroneous application of reasoning processes as constitutive of knowledge, indicating a flaw in linking knowledge solely to intellectual virtues**
