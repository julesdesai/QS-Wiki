## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a personâ€™s beliefs are entirely internally coherent but based on a fictional narrative. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows something about the narrative or that he knows nothing. If we say the person knows something about the narrative, then we paradoxically allow false propositions to be known. If we say the person knows nothing, then coherence does not suffice for knowledge.**
