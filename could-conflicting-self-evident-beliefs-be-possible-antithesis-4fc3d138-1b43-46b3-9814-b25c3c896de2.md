## Content

**Imagine two individuals possessing a self-evident belief that contradicts each other, such as conflicting intuitions about moral beliefs. Intuitively, it seems possible for both to perceive their belief as self-evident, which implies either the independence or fallibility of self-evidence.**, **A logical fact is that mutually contradictory beliefs cannot both be true, which questions the reliability of perceived self-evidence when beliefs conflict.**
