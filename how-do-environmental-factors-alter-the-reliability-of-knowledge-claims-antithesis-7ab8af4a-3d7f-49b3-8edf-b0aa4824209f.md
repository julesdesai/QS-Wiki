## Content

**Consider a scenario where an environmental change, such as a normally reliable GPS malfunctioning due to external interference, leads a person to form a belief that is both true and the result of a formerly reliable process. Intuitively, we question whether the reliability in such an environmentshifted context allows this person to know the GPS's information given its unreliability in this instance.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests reliability must be robust across relevant environments, which challenges the notion that one instance of truth and reliability suffice for knowledge.**
