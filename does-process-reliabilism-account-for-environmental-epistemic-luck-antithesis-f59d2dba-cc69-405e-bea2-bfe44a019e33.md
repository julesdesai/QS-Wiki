## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition formed by reliable processes, but where the truth of the proposition is accidentally preserved by an unusual environmental factor, like sheer luck. Intuitively, such environmental epistemic luck does not confer knowledge even though all the criteria of process reliabilism are met.**, **There is a principle that true knowledge should be resistant to luck not only in internal beliefs but also with respect to external environment incidents. A chance environmental factor preserving truth challenges process reliabilism.**
