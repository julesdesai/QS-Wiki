## Content

**There is a plausible principle that distinguishes knowledge from fortuitously true belief, whereby knowledge requires more than just a causal connection; it must involve non-accidental correctness**, **If a person guesses the outcome of a coin flip based purely on a hunch and gets it right, intuitively, they do not have knowledge of the outcome, suggesting that the causal account is inadequate in distinguishing such cases**
