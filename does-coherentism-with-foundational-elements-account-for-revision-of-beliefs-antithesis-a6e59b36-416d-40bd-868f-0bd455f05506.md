## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person revises their belief about climate change after evaluating new scientific evidence. This illustrates the process of belief revision based on new information, which does not always involve coherent incorporation into an existing web of beliefs initially.**, **It is implausible that all new knowledge requires immediate coherence with an interconnected system since real-life cases often necessitate belief revision prior to achieving coherence.**
