## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person holds a true belief justified by selective perception, due to cognitive bias. Intuitively, we either have to say that this person knows the proposition or they do not know, but the bias suggests they should not know.**, **A principle suggests that objectivity in the justification process is crucial for knowledge, in contrast with the sufficiency of justified true belief when biases are present.**
