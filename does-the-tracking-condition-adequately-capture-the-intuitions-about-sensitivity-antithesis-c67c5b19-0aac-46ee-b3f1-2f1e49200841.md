**There is a plausible principle that a person knows a proposition if they would not believe it if it were false. This principle together with the tracking condition suggests that tracking should be sensitive to changes in the truth of the proposition. However, intuitively, there could be cases where tracking occurs without sensitivity to falsehood, questioning the adequacy of tracking for knowledge.**
