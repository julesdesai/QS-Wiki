## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is formed through an unreliable process but is coincidentally true and seems justified by external evidence. Intuitively, we might still say this is a case of knowledge because the external evidence supports the truth of the belief.**, **It is implausible that reliability should be the sole determining factor in defining knowledge when external factors present a justified belief.**
