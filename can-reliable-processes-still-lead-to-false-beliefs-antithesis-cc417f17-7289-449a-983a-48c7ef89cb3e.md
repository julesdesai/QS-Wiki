## Content

**Consider a scenario where diagnostic tests are generally very accurate but occasionally malfunction without noticeable signs, leading someone to believe they have a condition they do not have. Intuitively, we would judge that while the process is generally reliable, the specific belief is not knowledge as it is false.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable processes can sometimes produce incorrect outcomes, which implies a reliable process does not guarantee true belief, challenging its sufficiency to account for knowledge.**
