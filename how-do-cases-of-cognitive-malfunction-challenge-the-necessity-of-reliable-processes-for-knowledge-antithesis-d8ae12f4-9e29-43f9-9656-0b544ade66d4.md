## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief due to a malfunction in an otherwise reliable cognitive process. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge is incompatible with cognitive malfunction, even if the usual process is reliable. This principle suggests that a true belief arising from malfunction cannot be considered knowledge.**
