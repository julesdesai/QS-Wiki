## Content

**Consider a scenario where each reason in an infinite chain is weak or questionable. Intuitively, we would judge that such a chain does not provide robust justification, despite its infinite nature.**, **A plausible principle is that justification should lead to epistemic certainty or reliability. An infinite chain with weak reasons does not meet this requirement.**
