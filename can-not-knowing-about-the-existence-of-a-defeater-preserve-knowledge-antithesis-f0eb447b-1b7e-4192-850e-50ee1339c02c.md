## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that it will rain because they saw a weather forecast. Intuitively, we would judge that they know it will rain if the forecast is correct and there are no defeaters.**, **Consider a scenario where unbeknownst to the person, the forecast was originally incorrect but was coincidentally changed to be accurate after they formed their belief. Intuitively, we would judge that there was a defeater, so the person does not know it will rain.**, **Knowledge with a no-defeaters clause requires that there are no defeaters at any point, hence in such cases, intuitive judgments about knowledge do not align with having no defeaters.**
