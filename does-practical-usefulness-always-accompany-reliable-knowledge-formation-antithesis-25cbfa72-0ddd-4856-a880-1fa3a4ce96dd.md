## Content

**Suppose a paleontologist discovers a fossil accurately dating back millions of years using reliable carbon dating methods. The discovery has no immediate practical consequences.**, **It is implausible to deny the paleontologist's knowledge of the fossil's age because the belief is true and reliably formed, even if not practically useful.**
