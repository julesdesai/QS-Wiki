## Content

**The requirement that a proposition must be true for it to constitute knowledge does not adequately handle propositions about future events.**, **Consider a person claiming to know a future event, like predicting tomorrowâ€™s weather with certainty, which can only be confirmed after the fact.**, **Intuitively, this presents a challenge in claiming knowledge of future occurrences despite a reliably formed basis unless the event occurs as predicted.**
