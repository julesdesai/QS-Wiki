## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is formed by a reliable process that fails to change when the truth of the belief alters. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the belief because of process reliability, or that the lack of sensitivity to truth means the belief is not knowledge. If we say they know because of reliability, this ignores the necessity of truth-sensitivity for knowledge. If we say the lack of sensitivity means it is not knowledge, this challenges the sufficiency of reliability.**
