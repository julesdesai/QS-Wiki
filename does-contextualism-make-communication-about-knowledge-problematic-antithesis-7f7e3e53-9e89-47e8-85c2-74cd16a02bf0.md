## Content

**Suppose person A asserts that they know a proposition in a context with low epistemic standards, yet person B, in a high-standard context, disputes this same assertion. Intuitively, this results in communicative misunderstandings and challenges the coherence of conversations involving knowledge claims.**, **It is implausible that the meaning of "to know" should shift so drastically as to render discussions about knowledge unstable or incoherent due to context changes.**
