## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition that is true in the actual world but false in many nearby possible worlds, such as winning a lottery ticket not due to understanding probability but sheer luck. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that their knowledge claim is undermined by the sensitivity of the belief to these possible worlds.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, a belief should remain true not only in the actual world but also in most nearby possible worlds. This principle together with the use of nearby possible worlds to assess truth entails that propositions true by luck do not amount to knowledge.**
