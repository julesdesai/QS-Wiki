## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person sees an object and forms a true belief about its nature. If, in a nearby possible world, the lighting conditions were slightly different, then their belief would be false. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the fact given they see the object or that they do not know it because of the potential falsity. If we say they know it, then we struggle to account for the influence of modal variations. If we say they do not know, this contradicts their true justified belief.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true.**
