## Content

**Assessing the reliability of a cognitive process often relies on reasoning from within the same process, leading to a form of circular justification.**, **If we use inductive reasoning to establish the reliability of our inductive reasoning processes, we assume the reliability we aim to prove, leading to a circularity problem.**, **This makes the criteria for knowledge based on reliability problematic, as the reliability criteria itself lacks independent validation.**
