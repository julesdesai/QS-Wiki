## Content

**A case in which a person has a belief that aligns with true contextually justified propositions might not qualify as knowledge if their belief is not substantially based on evidence or reasons supporting the truth of the proposition.**, **It is implausible that merely holding a belief with sufficient external justification, even if contextually defined, is sufficient for knowledge without internal conviction.**
