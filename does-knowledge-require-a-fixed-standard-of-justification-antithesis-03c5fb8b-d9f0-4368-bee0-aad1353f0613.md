## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should account for varying standards in different contexts. This principle together with the notion of a universally fixed standard for justification entails a failure to explain why different contexts seem to require different levels of justification.**, **A scenario can be imagined where two identical propositions are believed, but one context demands a higher justification standard due to higher stakes. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that knowledge requires different justification levels.**
