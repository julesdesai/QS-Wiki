## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, both belief in the proposition and the truth of the proposition are necessary.**, **Situations can arise where belief is contextually justified, but the truth is not established, or vice versa.**, **Such cases where belief and truth are disjoint challenge the coherence between being justified in believing and knowing.**, **The potential disjunction between belief and truth in justification conflicts with the cohesive demands of knowing under this view.**
