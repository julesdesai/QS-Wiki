## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition through luck rather than intellectual virtue. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person still knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a person believes a true proposition, then they might still have knowledge even without intellectual virtue. This principle, together with scenarios of knowledge through luck, entails that intellectual virtue might not be necessary for knowledge.**
