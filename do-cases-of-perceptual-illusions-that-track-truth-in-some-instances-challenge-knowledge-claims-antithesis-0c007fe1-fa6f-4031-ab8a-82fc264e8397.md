## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person experiences a perceptual illusion but coincidentally their belief about the scene tracks the truth because of unusual circumstances. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would hesitate to assert that this is knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be claimed in situations largely influenced by unreliable perceptual factors.**
