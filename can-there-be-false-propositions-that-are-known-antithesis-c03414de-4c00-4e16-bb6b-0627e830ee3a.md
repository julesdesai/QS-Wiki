## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a scientist falsely accepts a discredited theory but all evidence at their disposal justifies this belief and the theory is accepted by the scientific community. Intuitively, this could be seen as knowledge by the scientist.**, **It is implausible that truth is an absolute requirement for knowledge if a belief is justified by all available evidence and accepted by relevant peers.**
