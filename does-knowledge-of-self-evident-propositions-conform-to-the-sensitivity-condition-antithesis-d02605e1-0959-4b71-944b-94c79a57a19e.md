## Content

**For self-evident propositions like "I exist", it seems obvious that one knows it is true upon reflection**, **There is no plausible counterfactual scenario where the proposition "I exist" is false and the person understands they must stop believing it**, **The necessity to disbelieve if false could fail for these propositions, complicating their alignment with the sensitivity condition**
