## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a scientist, using highly reliable but not infallible equipment, records a measurement that might slightly deviate due to unnoticed equipment malfunction, yet inadvertently arrives at the exact true measure. Intuitively, we would judge this as a case involving luck rather than knowledge since the belief was not formed with absolute certainty.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires absolute certainty in beliefs to avoid luck, which suggests that fallible justification does not suffice for knowledge.**
