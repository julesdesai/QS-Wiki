**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a connection between belief and truth that excludes luck.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified belief that a friend's car is in the driveway based on seeing a convincing replica. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know the car is there, even if by coincidence the car is actually in the driveway.**
