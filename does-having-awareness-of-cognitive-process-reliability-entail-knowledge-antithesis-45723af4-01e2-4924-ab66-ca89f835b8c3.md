## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition because of a reliable process, yet they have no awareness of the process's reliability due to amnesia. Intuitively, we would judge this person lacks knowledge.**, **It seems plausible that awareness of reliability should not be a necessary condition for knowledge since cognitive processes can be reliable even when not consciously monitored by the individual.**
