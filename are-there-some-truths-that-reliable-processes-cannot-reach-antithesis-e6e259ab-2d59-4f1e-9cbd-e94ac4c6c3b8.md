## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which complex or abstract truths are inaccessible to reliable cognitive processes due to their inherent limitations. Intuitively, we either have to say that such truths are knowledge or not. If we say they are knowledge, then not all knowledge comes from reliable processes. If we say they are not knowledge, we exclude genuine truths from being known.**
