## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone has a true belief that a distant star is in a particular location based on a reliable telescope reading, but the person has randomly picked the telescope settings without understanding them. In such a scenario, intuitively, the person does not know the star's location despite their true belief.**, **A case in which someone has a true belief about an outcome based on sheer luck is not a case where the belief fulfills the knowledge condition of necessity.**
