## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alex, believes a proposition that there is a pink elephant in the room solely because they have been given a deceptively realistic virtual reality experience showing this. The proposition happens to be true because, unbeknownst to Alex, a prankster has placed a pink elephant statue in the room. Intuitively, we would judge that Alex does not know that there is a pink elephant in the room.**, **There is a plausible principle that if justification, truth, and belief are sufficient for knowledge, a person like Alex should be considered to know the proposition. This principle together with the scenario entails that justification, truth, and belief are not sufficient for knowledge.**
