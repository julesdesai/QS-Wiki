## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition solely due to luck, such as correctly guessing that it will rain tomorrow without any weather information. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know it will rain or that they do not know. If we say they know, then knowledge is merely a lucky guess.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is sensitive to its truth. If the belief was formed without justification, then intuitively it should not qualify as knowledge.**
