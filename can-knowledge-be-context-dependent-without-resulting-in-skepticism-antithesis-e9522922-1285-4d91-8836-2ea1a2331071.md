## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person in a relaxed setting claims to know a simple mathematical fact, such as 2+2=4, which meets low standards of justification. In a different scenario, a mathematician in a professional context requires higher standards of rigor to claim knowledge of the same fact. This discrepancy creates room for skepticism regarding what knowledge truly is across varying contexts.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be both context-dependent and secure against skepticism. If meeting different standards of justification can both lead to knowledge claims, it threatens the stability of our understanding of knowledge itself.**
