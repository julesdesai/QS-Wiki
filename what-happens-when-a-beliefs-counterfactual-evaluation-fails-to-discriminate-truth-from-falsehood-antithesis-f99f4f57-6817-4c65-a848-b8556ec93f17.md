## Content

**A person's judgment must effectively distinguish true propositions from false ones to be considered knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a belief is insensitive to counterfactual evaluations in which both true and false information are presented reliably.**, **Such insensitivity questions the judgment's ability to be deemed knowledge, for it lacks effective discrimination necessary for accurate understanding.**
