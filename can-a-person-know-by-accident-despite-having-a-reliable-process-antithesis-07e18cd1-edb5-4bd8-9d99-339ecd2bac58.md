## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person undergoes a reliable cognitive process that usually leads to true beliefs, but in a particular instance, they form a true belief by sheer accident, disconnected from the cognitive process used. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not know the proposition despite the reliable process.**, **A reliable cognitive process is expected to consistently produce true beliefs, but reliability does not guarantee truth in every instance.**, **It is possible for a belief to be true, justified, and produced by an ostensibly reliable process, yet lack a genuine connection to that process that constitutes knowledge.**
