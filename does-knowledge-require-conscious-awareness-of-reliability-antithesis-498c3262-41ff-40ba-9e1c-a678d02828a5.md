## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief through a reliable cognitive process without being aware of the reliability of the process. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks a complete understanding of their belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires an awareness of the justification or reliability of one's belief. This principle together with the scenario implies that just having a reliable process might not be sufficient for knowledge.**
