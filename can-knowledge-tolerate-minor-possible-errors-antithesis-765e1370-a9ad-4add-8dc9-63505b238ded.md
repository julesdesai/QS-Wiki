## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes two plus two equals four, the belief is true, and in all nearby possible worlds except one, the belief remains true. The single exception is a world where a minor calculation mistake is made. Intuitively, we would still judge the person knows two plus two equals four, despite the possible error world.**, **There is a plausible principle that minor possible errors should not affect knowledge attributions, and this principle suggests that near perfection is too stringent for knowledge.**
