## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person guesses a lottery number, believes they will lose, but their guess is correct. The proposition that their number would win is true. The justification for the guess meets low contextual standards due to the nature of the lottery. However, since the person believes they will lose, intuitively this does not seem like knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where contextual standards for justification are extremely low, such as casual speculation, yet the speculation is accidentally true. If we require that the person must believe the proposition for knowledge, then in cases where their belief is absent, knowledge cannot be said to exist, even with correct speculation.**
