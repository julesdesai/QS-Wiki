## Content

**Consider scenarios where individuals form beliefs based on ordinary sensory experiences, such as identifying a tree by sight, leading to true beliefs typically regarded as knowledge. If absolute certainty or infallibility of perception is required, then the absence of infallibility in normal sensory processes challenges the notion of perceptual beliefs as knowledge. This questions the Anti-Gettier condition incorporating infallibility.**
