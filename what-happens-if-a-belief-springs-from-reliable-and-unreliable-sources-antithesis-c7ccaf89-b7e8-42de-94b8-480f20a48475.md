## Content

**Suppose a belief is formed from a mixture of reliable and unreliable testimonies about a fact that turns out true, like predicting an election outcome from both expert and random speculative opinions. Intuitively, such belief does not clear the bar for knowledge.**, **It is plausible that for a belief to constitute knowledge, it must be formed entirely on reliable grounds without recourse to unreliable sources.**
