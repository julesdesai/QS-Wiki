## Content

**Suppose we have a case where one individual believes a true proposition through a complex scientific method, while another believes the same through guesswork, yet they both believe accurately. Intuitively, we might judge only the first individual knows the proposition.**, **It is implausible to attribute knowledge equivalently to distinct cognitive processes of differing reliability when they converge on the same belief.**
