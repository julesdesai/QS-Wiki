## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person named Alex automatically and accurately recalls information without actively engaging in any reasoning or critical thinking. Intuitively, we would judge that Alex still knows the information despite the absence of conscious effort.**, **It is implausible that knowledge necessarily requires active, conscious intellectual effort. Instead, the knowledge could manifest from well-practiced cognitive abilities functioning in the background, independent of conscious intellectual virtues.**
