## Content

**Reliabilism claims that a true belief formed by a reliable process is knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case where one uses the outcome of a belief-forming process to evaluate the reliability of that very process.**, **Intuitively, judging the reliability of a process by its own results leads to circular reasoning, which challenges the soundness of using reliabilism in such circumstances.**
