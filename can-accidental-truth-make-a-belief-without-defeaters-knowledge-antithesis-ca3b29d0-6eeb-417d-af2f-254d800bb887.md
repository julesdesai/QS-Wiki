## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes the time based on a stopped clock that coincidentally shows the correct time. Intuitively, we would judge that they believe the correct time but do not know it because it is an accidental truth.**, **Knowledge with a no-defeaters clause would suggest the person knows the time if the belief is true and there are no defeaters. However, our intuition suggests that despite no active defeaters, knowledge requires more than an accidental truth.**
