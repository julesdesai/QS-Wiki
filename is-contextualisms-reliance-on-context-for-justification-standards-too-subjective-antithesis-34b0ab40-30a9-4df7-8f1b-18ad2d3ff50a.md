## Content

**It is implausible that justification standards can vary greatly between different contexts without leading to subjectivity in knowledge claims.**, **Suppose we have two people in different contexts with the same belief about a true proposition. Intuitively, we might say one knows it while the other does not, depending on their contexts. This suggests inconsistency in how knowledge is ascribed.**
