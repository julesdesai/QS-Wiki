## Content

**Consider a scenario in which members of a society hold a widely shared false belief due to a common epistemic practice. Intuitively, we would judge that the method of belief formation lacks the requisite intellectual virtue for knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a society where everyone believes and acts virtuously based on false information. It is implausible that their collective exercise of intellectual virtue compensates for the falsehood of the belief.**
