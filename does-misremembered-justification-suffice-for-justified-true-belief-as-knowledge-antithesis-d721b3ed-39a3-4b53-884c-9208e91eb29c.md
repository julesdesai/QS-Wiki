## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Olivia believes that a historical figure was born in 1920 because she vaguely recalls reading it somewhere, though she misremembers the source. It turns out the belief is true. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Olivia does not know the birth year despite having a justified true belief, due to the unclear or misremembered justification.**
