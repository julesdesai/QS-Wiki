## Content

**Consider a person who forms beliefs about the quality of scientific research based solely on publications from journals they respect. However, since the journals exhibit a bias against publishing negative results, the process of reading only such journals skews their beliefs. Intuitively, beliefs formed under these circumstances appear not to constitute knowledge.**, **Certain biases within belief-forming processes can prevent the formation of knowledge by skewing the input or interpretation of evidence. Even when these processes are generally reliable, inherent biases can lead to consistently false beliefs when the issues are not adequately addressed.**
