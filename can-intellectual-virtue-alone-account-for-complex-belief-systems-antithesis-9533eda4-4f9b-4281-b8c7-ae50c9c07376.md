## Content

**Consider a situation where a person constructs a complex belief system based on diverse sources: empirical data, testimony, and personal reasoning. It would be challenging to attribute the justification solely to their intellectual virtues given the intricate and multifaceted nature of the sources. Intuitively, we might question whether intellectual virtues alone could sufficiently justify such a broad belief system.**, **There is a plausible principle that the complexity and external interdependencies of some beliefs require more than just intellectual virtues for justified belief formation, highlighting a potential deficiency in the necessity claim of intellectual virtues.**
