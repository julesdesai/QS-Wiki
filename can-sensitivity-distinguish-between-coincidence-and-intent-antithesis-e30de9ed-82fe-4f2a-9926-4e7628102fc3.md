## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an outcome occurs coincidentally, like winning a lottery, due to random chance, as opposed to achieving an intended goal based on deliberate action and belief. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge should differentiate intentional success from mere coincidence.**, **The sensitivity condition might not effectively distinguish between true beliefs that result from intention and those that result from coincidence, indicating a limitation in its ability to capture the nuances of knowledge attribution.**
