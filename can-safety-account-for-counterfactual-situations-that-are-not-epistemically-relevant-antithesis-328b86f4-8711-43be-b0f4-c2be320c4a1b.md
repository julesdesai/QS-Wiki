## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence, and in most counterfactual scenarios where the evidence slightly changes, the belief remains true. In such cases, it is plausible the person still lacks knowledge if those counterfactual changes make the actual evidence irrelevant.**, **The concept of "nearby possible situations" may include cases irrelevant to actual belief formation, thus potentially undermining the idea that safety ensures knowledge.**
