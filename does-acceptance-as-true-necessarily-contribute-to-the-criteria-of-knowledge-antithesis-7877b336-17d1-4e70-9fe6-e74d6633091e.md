## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a person may accept a true proposition based only on false premises. This acceptance without proper justification questions its status as knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a gambler accepts a belief about a race's outcome based on a dream, which turns out true. Intuitively, the truth's connection to reality is tenuous here, challenging its qualification as knowledge.**
