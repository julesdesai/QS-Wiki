## Content

**Suppose a person reads a news article reporting that a specific political candidate has won an election. The belief is justified based on a reputable source and the belief is true because the candidate did win. However, it turns out the initial report was based on a typographical error.**, **Intuitively, one doubts that the person 'knows' the candidate won, suggesting that misinformation undermines the justification aspect of knowledge.**
