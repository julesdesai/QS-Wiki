## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a ticket in a large fair lottery and strongly believes their ticket will lose, based on the reliability of statistics about lottery odds. Intuitively, we hesitate to say the person knows their ticket will lose, despite the belief being true and formed by a reliable cognitive process.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a person knows something, then it should not be possible for them to be wrong so easily under normal circumstances. The case of the person believing their lottery ticket will lose challenges this because they could indeed win, showing a gap in process reliabilism for such instances.**
