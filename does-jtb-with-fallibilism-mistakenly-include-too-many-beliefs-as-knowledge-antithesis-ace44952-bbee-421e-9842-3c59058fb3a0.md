## Content

**Consider a situation in which a wide range of true yet fallibly justified beliefs are considered knowledge. Intuitively, this overinclusiveness seems counterintuitive to a more stringent concept of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that the concept of knowledge should be selective and excluding of beliefs that do not meet high standards, which fallibilism might undermine.**
