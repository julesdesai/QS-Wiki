## Content

**Consider a scenario in which everyone in a community, due to a universally convincing but false evidence, believes a proposition that has every appearance of truth. Intuitively, we would hesitate to say that these people have knowledge, suggesting truth is necessary, yet the strength of their evidence presents a compelling case otherwise.**, **It is implausible that a collective belief that is universally justified and consistent with all available evidence still lacks the status of knowledge merely because the proposition turns out false.**
