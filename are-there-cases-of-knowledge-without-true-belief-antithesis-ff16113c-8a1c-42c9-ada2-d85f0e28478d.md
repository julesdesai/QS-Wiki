## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual has strong evidence for a proposition, but their belief fluctuates and they do not maintain it. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might still say they know it when relying on the evidence, despite not having a stable belief.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge can sometimes rely on episodic conviction rather than continuous belief.**
