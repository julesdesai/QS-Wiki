## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on solid external justification, but a defeater emerges that the person reasonably dismisses as unreliable. Intuitively, the belief still seems to constitute knowledge.**, **If knowledge exists despite an ignored defeater, the necessity of no defeaters is challenged, suggesting other factors play a role in determining knowledge.**
