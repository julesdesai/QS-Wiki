**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief about the time by looking at a stopped clock at exactly the right moment, leading to a true belief. Intuitively, we would judge that this is not knowledge.**, **A belief can be true and formed by a process considered generally reliable, yet not count as knowledge if the reliability is coincidental and not causally related to the truth of the belief.**
