## Content

**Consider a scenario where two scientists with coherent but different belief systems interpret the same experimental data differently. Intuitively, we might judge that only one interpretation can lead to knowledge if it corresponds more closely to objective truth, indicating that something beyond coherence is necessary for knowledge.**
