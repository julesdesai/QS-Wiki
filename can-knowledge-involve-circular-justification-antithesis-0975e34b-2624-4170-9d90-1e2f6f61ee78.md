## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justification for knowledge must not be circular.**, **Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition because it is used to justify itself, like using a newspaper's credibility to justify belief in the newspaper's report. Intuitively, we judge that this does not constitute knowledge due to its circular justification.**
