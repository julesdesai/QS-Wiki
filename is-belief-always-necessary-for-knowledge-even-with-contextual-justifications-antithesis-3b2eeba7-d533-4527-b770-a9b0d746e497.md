**It is implausible that belief is unnecessary for knowledge, as belief is generally considered a foundational component of knowing.**, **Suppose we have a person who has perfect foundational justifications for a proposition but does not believe the proposition. Intuitively, such a person does not possess knowledge, suggesting that belief is indeed necessary.**
