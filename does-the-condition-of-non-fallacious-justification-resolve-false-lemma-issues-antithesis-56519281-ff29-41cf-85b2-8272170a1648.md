## Content

**Suppose a person, Sarah, believes a proposition based on a complex chain of reasoning, where one intermediate inference is false but irrelevant, leading to a true belief. Intuitively, we might doubt that Sarah genuinely knows the proposition, despite true belief and non-fallacious justification.**, **This suggests that non-fallacious justification does not adequately address cases where reasoning contains false steps that do not directly lead to the conclusion.**
