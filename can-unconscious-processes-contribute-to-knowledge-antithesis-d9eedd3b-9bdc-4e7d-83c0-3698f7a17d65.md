## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person correctly recognizes a face due to unconscious pattern recognition without being aware of how they do so. Intuitively, we would say that this person knows whose face it is.**, **There exists a plausible principle that knowledge can arise from automated cognitive processes that do not involve conscious awareness of justification.**
