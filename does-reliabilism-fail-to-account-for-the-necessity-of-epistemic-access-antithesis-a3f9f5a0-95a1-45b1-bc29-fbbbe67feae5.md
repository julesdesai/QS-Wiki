## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowing requires some awareness or access to the reliability of the belief-forming process. This principle, together with the lack of awareness scenarios, challenges the idea that reliability alone suffices for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person is unaware of the processes by which their beliefs are reliably formed. Intuitively, we would judge that lack of awareness undermines their knowledge, which challenges the sufficiency condition in reliabilism.**
