## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition through a reliable process, but similar processes lead others to hold false beliefs in different instances. In such a scenario, intuitively it seems that reliability alone doesn't guarantee truth across all instances.**, **There is a plausible principle that a truly reliable process should not result in false beliefs for any proposition under similar circumstances. This suggests that the occurrence of false beliefs questions the sufficiency of the reliable process for knowledge.**
