## Content

**Safety conditions often rely on the belief's truth not being easily false, often limited to realistically possible situations rather than all conceivable worlds**, **A belief may be safe in all realistically possible worlds but not in far-fetched conceivable worlds, prompting the question of whether such a version of safety is apt for an encompassing theory of knowledge**, **The discrepancy between what is realistically versus conceivably possible suggests a tension within defining safetyâ€™s sufficiency for knowledge**
