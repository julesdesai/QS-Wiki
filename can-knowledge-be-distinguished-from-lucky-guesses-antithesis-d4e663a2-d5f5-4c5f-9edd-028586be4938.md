## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief through a seemingly virtuous method, but were actually just guessing. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge or they do not. If we say they have knowledge, then this conflicts with our understanding that knowledge cannot be purely accidental. If we say they do not have knowledge, then intellectual virtue does not account for all aspects of knowledge.**
