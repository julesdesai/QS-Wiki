## Content

**Suppose we consider a case in which a person forms a correct belief dependent on an expert’s testimony who occasionally errs. Intuitively, we either have to say that all dependence on testimony is benign or it isn't. If we say it is benign, then this seems to conflict with the intuition that the expert’s intermittent errors impact knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the safety condition sufficiently accounts for all epistemic dependence, as certain dependencies might compromise belief truth across nearby worlds.**
