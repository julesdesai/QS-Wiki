## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a true belief based on misleading evidence, yet through sheer luck, the belief aligns with intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we either have to say that this is knowledge or that it is not. If we say it is knowledge, then we overlook the role of reliable evidence. If we say it is not knowledge, then truth, belief, and intellectual virtue are not sufficient.**
