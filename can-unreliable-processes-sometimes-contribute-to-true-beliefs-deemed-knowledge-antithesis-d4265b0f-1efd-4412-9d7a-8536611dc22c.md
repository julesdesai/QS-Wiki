## Content

**Consider a person who forms a belief by consulting an unreliable process like guessing lottery numbers, yet through chance, the guess is correct, and the belief is true. Intuitively, one might still be hesitant to call this knowledge.**, **Imagine a scenario where one relies on a fallible method like guessing which accidentally coincides with the truth. It seems implausible to say that the belief constitutes knowledge, despite the process ending with a correct result.**
