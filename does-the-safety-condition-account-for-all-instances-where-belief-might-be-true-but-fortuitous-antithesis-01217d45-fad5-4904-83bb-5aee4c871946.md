## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone believes the proposition that it will rain tomorrow due to a random guess. In this scenario, intuitively the person does not have knowledge, even if it does indeed rain.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be attributed to beliefs that are accidentally true. This principle, together with the scenario, entails that the safety condition might fail to exclude cases of fortuitous truth.**
