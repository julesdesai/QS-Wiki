## Content

**A situation where person P has a justified belief in proposition Q, Q is true, and P's awareness of what constitutes a defeater is incomplete.**, **Intuitively, if P's understanding of potential defeaters is incomplete, it seems plausible to consider P's claim to knowledge as potentially compromised.**, **This suggests that an incomplete grasp of defeaters challenges the idea that no defeaters alone suffice for knowledge.**
