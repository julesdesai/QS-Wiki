## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is true and based entirely on a trusted expert's testimony. Intuitively, we either have to say that reliance on expert testimony suffices for knowledge, or that additional justifications are needed. If we say additional justifications are needed, it seems implausible due to the reliability of the testimony alone.**
