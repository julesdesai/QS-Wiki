## Content

**Suppose there is a scenario where a person hears a reliable news broadcast that effectively represents the state of the world, leading to a true belief. However, in nearly all nearby possible worlds, the broadcast inaccurately reports the situation, leading to false beliefs. Intuitively, the person’s true belief in the actual world appears unstable because it could easily have been false.**, **In this scenario, the person’s belief is true in the actual world, but it would be false in most nearby possible worlds, questioning whether the person's belief truly constitutes knowledge due to instability across close worlds.**
