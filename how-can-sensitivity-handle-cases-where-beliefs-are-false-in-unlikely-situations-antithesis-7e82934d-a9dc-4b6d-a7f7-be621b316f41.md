## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition that is true in nearly all situations but false in a very specific, unlikely situation. Intuitively, we might still want to attribute knowledge to the person.**, **A principle of sensitivity might entail retracting knowledge if the proposition is false in just one unlikely scenario. However, intuitively, knowledge should be robust enough to withstand these rare cases.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be secure enough to encompass a broad range of possible situations, even those rare or unlikely.**
