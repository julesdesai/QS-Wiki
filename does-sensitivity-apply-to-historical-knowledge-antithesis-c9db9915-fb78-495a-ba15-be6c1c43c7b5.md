## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person knows a historical fact based on well-documented evidence. If the fact were false, they wouldn't have different belief due to historical narratives being rigid. Intuitively, this doesn't negate their historical knowledge, as historical contexts limit sensitivity.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge of historical facts should not be discarded due to their insensitivity to counterfactual scenarios in which foundational details cannot change.**
