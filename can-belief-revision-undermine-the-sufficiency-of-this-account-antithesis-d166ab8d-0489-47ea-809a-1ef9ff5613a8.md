## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person revises their belief due to new evidence that contradicts their initial belief, which was true and not easily false in similar situations.**, **Intuitively, we might argue that knowledge cannot solely rest on the truth and safety of a belief if new evidence suggests a lack of intellectual virtue in belief revision.**, **It seems implausible to locate knowledge where belief revision shows a deficiency in intellectual virtue, despite meeting truth and safety criteria.**
