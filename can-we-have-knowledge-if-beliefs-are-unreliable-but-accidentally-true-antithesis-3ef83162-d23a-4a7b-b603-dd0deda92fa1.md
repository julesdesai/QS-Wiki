## Content

**Suppose we have a person who generally forms beliefs based on unreliable methods, yet by sheer luck, their belief about a particular proposition is true. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge or they don't. If we say they have knowledge, then this seems inconsistent with the idea that knowledge requires reliability. If we say they don't have knowledge, then true belief without reliability does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible that true beliefs formed by unreliable methods constitute knowledge, given that reliability appears essential for knowledge.**
