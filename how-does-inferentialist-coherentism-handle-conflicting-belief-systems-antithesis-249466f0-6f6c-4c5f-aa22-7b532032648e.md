## Content

**Consider a scenario in two individuals possess coherent but mutually exclusive belief systems about the same factual proposition that happens to be true in one system but not the other. Intuitively, they both can’t know the proposition simultaneously.**, **There is a plausible principle that conflicting coherent systems undercut one’s claim to knowledge, raising doubts about reliance on coherence alone.**
