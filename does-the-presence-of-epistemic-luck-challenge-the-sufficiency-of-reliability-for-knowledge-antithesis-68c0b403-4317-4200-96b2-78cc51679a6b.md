## Content

**Suppose an individual predicts a future event with great accuracy by sheer luck yet employs a generally reliable reasoning process. Intuitively, such a lucky guess does not constitute knowledge despite the reliability of the cognitive process used, due to the heavy reliance on luck.**, **It is implausible that the sufficiency of cognitive reliability excludes the distorting effects of epistemic luck, which may undermine true understanding.**
