## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief about time based on a consistently correct but malfunctioning clock that happens to show the correct time. In such a scenario, intuitively we cannot count this as knowledge because the clock could easily have been wrong, challenging the notion that belief couldn't easily have been false is sufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must not be at the mercy of unreliable sources, which implies that beliefs depending on external, easily mutable factors fail as safe beliefs.**
