## Content

**Consider the case of mathematical knowledge, such as the belief that 2+2=4. This belief is necessarily true and does not vary across possible situations. Intuitively, we recognize this as knowledge without the need for tracking across different situations.**, **The nature of necessary truths challenges the idea that belief needs to track the truth across possible situations to constitute knowledge.**
