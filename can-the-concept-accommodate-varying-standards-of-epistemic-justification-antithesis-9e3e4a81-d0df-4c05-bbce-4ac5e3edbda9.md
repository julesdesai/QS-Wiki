## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a degree of justification that varies with context, such as stakes or importance. This principle together with variable standards for justification challenges the rigid conditions posited in the safety view.**, **Suppose the stakes are high; intuitively, more robust justification is required for knowledge than the safety conditions alone might provide.**
