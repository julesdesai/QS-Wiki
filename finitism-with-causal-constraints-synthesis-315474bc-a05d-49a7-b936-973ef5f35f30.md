**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their justification forms a finite chain**, **Finite chains of justification must maintain causal linkages between each successive reason**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their justification is a finite causally connected chain**
