## Content

**A person could have all their beliefs about a proposition be true and resistant to known defeaters; however, there might exist an unknown true proposition that could defeat that belief if known. Intuitively, such unknown factors should not affect whether the person knows the proposition.**, **Knowledge seems more stable if it cannot be unknowingly defeated.**
