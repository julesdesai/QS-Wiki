## Content

**Suppose there is a situation where P uses a reliable weather app, but the app's accuracy is currently compromised due to rare, undetected server errors. Intuitively, one would judge that P does not have knowledge regarding the weather today, despite using a normally reliable process.**, **A reliable process, when compromised and resulting in a coincidentally true belief, suggests that not all beliefs from reliable sources constitute knowledge absent consistent dependability.**
