## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a group consistently forms reliable true beliefs, but no single individual employs a reliable process, instead exhibiting collective reliability. Intuitively, we may sense difficulties in aligning such group dynamics with established notions of individual-centric reliable process-produced knowledge.**, **The concept of collective knowledge challenges the idea that individual belief formation through reliable processes is necessary for group beliefs to exhibit knowledge qualities.**
