## Content

**Consider a scenario where a pedestrian believes the traffic light is red based on seeing it and stops safely at the intersection. If infallible justification is required for the belief and the possibility of error exists, intuitively, common sense tells us the pedestrian knows the light is red, but infallibilism might suggest otherwise.**, **There is a plausible principle that common sense judgments, which guide everyday actions and decisions, should align with our epistemic understanding, suggesting infallibilism might contradict practical reasoning.**
