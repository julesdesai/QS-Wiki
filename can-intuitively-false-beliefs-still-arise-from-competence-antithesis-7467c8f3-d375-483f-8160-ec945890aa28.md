## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a belief based on a reliable process that is usually competent in normal situations, such as flipping a coin believed to be fair. In this scenario, they believe the coin will land heads up.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that just because the coin lands heads, does not mean the person truly knows it will do so, even if they believed it based on their usually reliable competence.**
