## Content

**Suppose a person P remembers an event but has unreliable memory known to create false narratives. P believes and justifies the occurrence of an event based on faulty memory. Intuitively, despite true belief, P does not have knowledge because memory unreliability undermines belief credibility.**, **A plausible principle is that reliable memory is necessary for memory-based knowledge. This principle, along with true belief and justification, supports the conclusion that unreliable memory precludes genuine knowledge.**
