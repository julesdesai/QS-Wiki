## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence, but they are later exposed to persuasive misinformation. Intuitively, if the person continues to believe the proposition despite the misinformation, we either have to say that their belief is stubborn or resilient knowledge. If we say it is stubborn, then it seems more like a flaw than knowledge.**
