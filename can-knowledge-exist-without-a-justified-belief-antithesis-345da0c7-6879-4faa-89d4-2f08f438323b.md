## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition purely based on an unreliable astrological reading, yet the proposition happens to be true and not informed by any falsehood. Intuitively, we would question whether this belief qualifies as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to constitute knowledge, the belief must have justification. This principle, when not satisfied, suggests the absence of knowledge.**, **Intuitively, if a belief is based on unreliable evidence, even if true and not derived from falsehood, it should not qualify as knowledge.**
