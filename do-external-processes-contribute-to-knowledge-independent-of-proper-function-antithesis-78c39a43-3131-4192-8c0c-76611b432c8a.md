## Content

**Envision a scenario in which Fiona acquires knowledge through reliance on external computational systems, with her cognitive faculties incapable of proper function. Intuition suggests Fiona possesses knowledge due to these external aids.**, **The necessity for cognitive faculties to function properly does not account for scenarios where external processes enhance or substitute human cognition to produce knowledge.**, **As technology increasingly influences knowledge acquisition, the sufficiency of proper cognitive function may be reduced or supplemented by external agents.**
