## Content

**Imagine a situation where all available evidence points towards a false proposition, and a person justifiably believes it based on that evidence. Intuitively, they would not have knowledge, as the evidence is misleading.**, **This shows that defeasible justification may not be sufficient if all evidence is misleading, indicating that true knowledge might require more than defeasible justification and truth; it also requires correct evidence.**
