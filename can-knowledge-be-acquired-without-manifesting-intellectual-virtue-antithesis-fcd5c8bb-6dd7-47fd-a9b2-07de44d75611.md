## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person named Sam has a tendency to get things right purely by luck rather than any intellectual efforts or virtues. Intuitively, we would judge that Sam does not possess knowledge because his correct beliefs do not stem from intellectual virtue.**, **It is plausible to claim that knowledge requires not just truth and belief, but a reliable method of belief-formation. This principle, combined with the notion that luck undermines reliability, suggests that merely having true beliefs via luck does not equate to knowledge.**
