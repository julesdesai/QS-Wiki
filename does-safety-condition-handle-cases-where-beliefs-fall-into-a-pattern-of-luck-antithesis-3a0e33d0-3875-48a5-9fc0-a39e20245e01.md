## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person consistently flips coins, predicting heads each time, and by sheer coincidence, each flip results in heads. Intuitively, we could say that these successes due to luck do not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the mere truth of their repeated beliefs, despite conforming to the safety condition, could count as knowledge.**
