## Content

**Consider a person who gains knowledge about a historical event solely through a testimony of a credible historian. Their belief is true and justified, though it relies more on the historian's intellectual virtues rather than their own. Intuitively, one might question whether reliance on another's virtues compromises the assertion that personal intellectual virtues are necessary for knowledge.**, **It is plausible that testimonial knowledge often arises from relying on another's intellectual virtues, which may conflict with a strict interpretation of intellectual virtues being necessary for personal knowledge justification.**
