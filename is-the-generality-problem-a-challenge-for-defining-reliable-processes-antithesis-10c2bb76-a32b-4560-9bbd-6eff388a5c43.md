**Defining what counts as a “reliable process” involves making arbitrary decisions at different levels of generality, rendering the assessment of process reliability difficult and potentially inconsistent.**, **The generality problem raises the question of which specific cognitive processes or types should be assessed for reliability, complicating clear criteria for knowledge.**
