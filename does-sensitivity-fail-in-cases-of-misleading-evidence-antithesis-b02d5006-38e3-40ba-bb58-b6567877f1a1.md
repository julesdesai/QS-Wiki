## Content

**Consider a situation in which a detective, Morgan, has strong evidence a suspect committed a crime, but the suspect is actually innocent. Intuitively, Morgan does not know the suspect committed the crime.**, **It is implausible for sensitivity to account for such cases where true beliefs formed from evidence still fail as knowledge.**
