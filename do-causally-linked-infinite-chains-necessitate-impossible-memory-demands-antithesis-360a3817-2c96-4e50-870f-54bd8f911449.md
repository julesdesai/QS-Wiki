## Content

**It is implausible that individuals possess the memory capacity to retain and process infinite chains of causally linked justifications.**, **Consider a situation where a historian attempts to justify a historical event belief with an infinite causally connected chain extending back millennia. Intuitively, our faculties seem incompetent to chronologically and causally track or store an infinite sequence through historical data.**
