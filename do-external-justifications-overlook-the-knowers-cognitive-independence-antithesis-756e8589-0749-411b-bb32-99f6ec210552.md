## Content

**Consider a circumstance where an individual's belief is continually justified by an external source, like a machine, without the person's involvement in the reasoning. Intuitively, this seems to diminish the person's role as a knower.**, **There is an intuitive appeal to the idea that knowledge should involve some form of cognitive independence or agency, which external justification might undermine.**
