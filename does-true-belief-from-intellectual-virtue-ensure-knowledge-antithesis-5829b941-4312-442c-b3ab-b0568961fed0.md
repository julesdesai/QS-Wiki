## Content

**Suppose there is a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on intellectual virtue, yet does so coincidentally; for example, they believe based on reasoning that happens to match the true state of affairs due to a lucky guess. Intuitively, we might judge that this is not genuine knowledge due to the coincidental nature of the belief.**, **It is implausible that merely having an intellectual virtue-based true belief ensures knowledge because it might simply be a lucky coincidence rather than reflect a cognitive achievement.**
