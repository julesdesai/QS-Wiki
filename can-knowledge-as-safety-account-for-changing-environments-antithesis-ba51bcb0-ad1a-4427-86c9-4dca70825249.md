## Content

**Imagine a person who believes a proposition true in their current setting but would be false if the environment changes slightly. While nearby possible worlds might still satisfy the safety condition, the sensitivity to environment changes questions the robustness of such knowledge.**, **A changeable environment can affect the truth of propositions, which prompts skepticism about a beliefâ€™s qualification as knowledge if it only holds under current conditions.**
