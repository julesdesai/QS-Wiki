## Content

**Case: person P finds a wallet thought lost, intuitively knowing its contents, due to their reliable memory of inventory. Unknown to P, money was replaced by a stranger, making the true belief lucky rather than reliable knowledge.**, **A principle is some beliefs arise from reliable processes, yet luck plays a role such that reliability does not sufficiently entail knowledge. Epistemic luck introduces elements unaccounted by reliability alone.**
