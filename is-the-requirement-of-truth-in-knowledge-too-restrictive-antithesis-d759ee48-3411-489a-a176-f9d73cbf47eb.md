## Content

**Consider a situation where a person operates with high confidence and accurate predictions based on a robust theory, which is later slightly modified but retains past predictive power. Intuitively, this does not nullify their past knowledge.**, **A plausible principle suggests that knowledge should accommodate theories that are functionally true over time, even with minor modifications.**, **It is implausible to demand absolute, unchanging truth when science and knowledge evolve, reflecting ongoing refinement rather than invalidation.**
