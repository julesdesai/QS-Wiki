## Content

**Consider a savant who can reliably derive true mathematical propositions due to an unusual cognitive makeup. Intuitively, one might recognize the savant's ability as a form of exceptional knowledge without recourse to proper-function standards.**, **There is a plausible principle that recognizes highly specialized but atypical cognitive faculties as capable of generating knowledge, despite not conforming to generalized standards of cognitive proper function.**
