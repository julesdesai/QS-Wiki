## Content

**Suppose the justification for a belief in one world is deemed strong, but similar justifications fail under scrutiny in slightly different possible worlds, leading to false beliefs. Intuition might suggest this weakens claims to knowledge.**, **It is plausible that true knowledge should not be challenged by variations of justifications leading to varying truths. Otherwise, the concept of knowledge loses robustness.**
