## Content

**Suppose an astronomer uses intellectually virtuous methods to assert a planetary alignment, but later discoveries nullify this alignment due to new data. Intuitively, we would judge that the astronomer's original assertion was not knowledge, as it was ultimately false.**, **The principle that truth is necessary for knowledge suggests that past true beliefs overturned by future evidence call into question whether they constituted knowledge in the first place.**
