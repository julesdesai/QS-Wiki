## Content

**Consider someone gaining an implicit understanding of language rules, such as grammar, without explicit teaching or intentional exercise of epistemic virtue. Intuitively, they seem to know these rules even if such knowledge did not arise from a conscious exercise of epistemic virtue.**, **It is implausible to claim that all our implicit knowledge forms should be products of deliberative, virtuous processes.**
