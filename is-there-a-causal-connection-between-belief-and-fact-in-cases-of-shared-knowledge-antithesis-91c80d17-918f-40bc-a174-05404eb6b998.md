## Content

**Suppose a group believes a proposition through a general consensus process. The initial individual's belief forms part of the causal connection but not directly to the fact supporting the belief. Intuitively, shared knowledge seems valid without a direct causal link.**, **Consider a scenario where multiple people believe a true proposition communicated through a chain without observing the fact. The causal link is to other beliefs, yet we perceive it as knowledge.**
