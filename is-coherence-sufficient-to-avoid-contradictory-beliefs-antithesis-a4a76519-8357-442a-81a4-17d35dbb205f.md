## Content

**Suppose a person P has a network of beliefs that includes both true and false beliefs, all of which coherently fit together. Intuitively, P does not know the true propositions simply because they coherently fit with false beliefs.**, **Coherence within a system of beliefs does not automatically exclude the presence of false beliefs, challenging the sufficiency of coherence for knowledge.**
