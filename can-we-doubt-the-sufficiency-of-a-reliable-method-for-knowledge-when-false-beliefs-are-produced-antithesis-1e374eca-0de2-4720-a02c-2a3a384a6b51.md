**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief that it is raining because they see people with umbrellas, but this is a coincidence since it is not raining; the belief is formed through a generally reliable method, seeing people with umbrellas usually indicates rain.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, the person does not know that it is raining, as their belief is false.**
