**Consider a scenario in which a person believes it will rain because the forecast predicts rain, and it indeed rains. However, if the forecast were slightly different, their belief would change. Intuitively, we judge that they know it will rain.**, **It is implausible that a belief changing with minor variations immediately disqualifies it from being knowledge, as the person seems well-informed about the rain prediction.**
