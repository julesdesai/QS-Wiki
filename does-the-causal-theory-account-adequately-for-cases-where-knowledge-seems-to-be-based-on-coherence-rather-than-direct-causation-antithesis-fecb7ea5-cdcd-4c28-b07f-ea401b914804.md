## Content

**Consider a detective who pieces together a series of clues, each offering some probability but collectively creating a coherent narrative that leads to the correct conclusion. Intuitively, the detective seems to know the outcome not through direct causation but rather through coherence.**, **Knowledge sometimes arises from the synthesis of information rather than a direct causal path from fact to belief.**
