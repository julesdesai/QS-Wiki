## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an infant or a non-human animal forms a true belief through instinct or simple perception without exercising intellectual virtues.**, **Intuitively, we either have to say the infant or animal has knowledge or deny it altogether. It seems implausible to deny that infants or animals can have any knowledge.**
