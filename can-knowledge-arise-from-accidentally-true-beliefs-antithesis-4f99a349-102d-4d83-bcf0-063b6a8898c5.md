## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified true belief that the coin in their pocket is a fair coin because an authority figure told them it was fair without checking herself**, **Suppose in this scenario, the coin turns out to be fair purely by chance even though it was manufactured defectively in most cases**, **This is a scenario in which the belief is both justified and true, but intuitively does not qualify as knowledge since the truth of the belief was accidental**
