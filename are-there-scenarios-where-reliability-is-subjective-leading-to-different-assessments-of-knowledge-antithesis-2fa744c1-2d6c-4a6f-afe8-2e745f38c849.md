**Consider a scenario where two individuals form beliefs based on the same process, which one considers reliable and the other does not because of differing prior experiences. Intuitively, it seems problematic that their assessments of knowledge would differ merely based on subjective judgments.**, **It is implausible that subjectivity regarding the reliability of a process should influence the determination of knowledge, as knowledge should ideally be an objective condition.**
