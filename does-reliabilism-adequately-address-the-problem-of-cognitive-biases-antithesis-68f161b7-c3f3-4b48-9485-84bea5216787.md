## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on a reliable news source that aligns with their confirmation bias, leading them to dismiss lots of credible contrary evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not possess knowledge, despite the initial reliable source.**, **There is a plausible principle that cognitive processes must not be impeded by biases to yield knowledge. This principle together with reliance on unreliable biases entails that processes reliably producing true beliefs are insufficient.**
