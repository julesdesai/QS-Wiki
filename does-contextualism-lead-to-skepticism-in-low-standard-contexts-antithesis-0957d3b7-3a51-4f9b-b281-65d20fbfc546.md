## Content

**There is a plausible principle that in a context with low epistemic standards, almost any belief could easily be considered knowledge. This principle together with the idea that standards vary drastically could mean people often mistakenly overestimate what they know.**, **If people routinely consider themselves to know things under low standards, then what counts as knowledge might not be sufficiently robust or informative.**
