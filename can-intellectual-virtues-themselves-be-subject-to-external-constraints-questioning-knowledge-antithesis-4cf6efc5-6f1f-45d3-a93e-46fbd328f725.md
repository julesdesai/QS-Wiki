## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's intellectual virtue is consistently overridden by misinformation they cannot control. Intuitively, we have to say their resultant beliefs, though true, are not known. This indicates intellectual virtue may not handle external knowledge barriers alone.**, **A situation where a person's intellectually virtuous belief contradicts widespread evidence misleadingly, but a true belief results challenges the notion that the virtue itself suffices for knowledge.**
