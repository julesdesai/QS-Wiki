## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a belief based on an unusual but true environmental factor, which could easily be different in most nearby worlds. Intuitively, such quirkiness would seem to undermine the person's claim to knowledge because the condition supporting the belief is fragile.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not depend on environmental quirks that do not hold steady across nearby possible worlds.**
