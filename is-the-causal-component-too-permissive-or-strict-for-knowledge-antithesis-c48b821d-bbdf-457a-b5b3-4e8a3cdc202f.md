## Content

**There is a plausible principle that too permissive an approach to causal justification allows for coincidental truths to count as knowledge, while too strict of a requirement might dismiss genuine cases where knowledge is obtained without overt causal connection. This principle highlights an underlying tension in delineating adequate causal links for knowledge.**
