## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, there should be no dependence on luck or coincidence. This principle, together with a case where a true belief is accidentally arrived at via intellectual virtue, suggests that intellectual virtue may not be sufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a situation where a hiker expertly finds their way to a destination due to a map error that was inconsequential by coincidence. Here, the true belief resulted from virtue but also luck, challenging the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
