## Content

**There is a plausible principle that alignment with probabilistic reasoning should reliably lead to truth for it to contribute to knowledge. However, in a case with faulty premises, probabilistic reasoning might still align with available evidence but lead to false conclusions.**, **Consider a scenario where a belief, aligned with probabilistic reasoning, turns out to be false due to incorrect initial assumptions or evidence. Intuitively, this suggests probabilistic reasoning itself is not infallibly truth-conducive.**
