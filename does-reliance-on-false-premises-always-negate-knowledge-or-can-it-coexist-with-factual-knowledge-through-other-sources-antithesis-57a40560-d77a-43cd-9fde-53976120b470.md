## Content

**A researcher accurately predicts a scientific phenomenon based on a model that correctly applies fundamental laws but includes an incorrect assumption about a non-impacting biographical detail of a scientist. Intuitively, the correct prediction should still be considered as knowledge.**, **It seems implausible to consider knowledge invalid if the false premise has no bearing on the logical conclusion drawn from accurate foundational principles.**
