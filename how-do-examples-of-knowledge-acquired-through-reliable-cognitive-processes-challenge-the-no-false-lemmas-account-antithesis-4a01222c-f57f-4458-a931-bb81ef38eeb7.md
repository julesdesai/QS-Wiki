## Content

**Consider a person using a reliable but not entirely infallible method, like eyesight, to form beliefs, some of which are incorrect. Intuitively, reliance on such a process can still yield knowledge.**, **Processes that occasionally involve false lemmas yet predominantly lead to true beliefs question whether having no false lemmas is essential for knowledge.**
