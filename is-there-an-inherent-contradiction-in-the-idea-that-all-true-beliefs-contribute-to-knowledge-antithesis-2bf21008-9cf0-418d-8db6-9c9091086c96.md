## Content

**There is a plausible principle that not all true beliefs, such as those derived from unreliable processes, contribute to our understanding and thus to knowledge. This principle implies that a beliefâ€™s origin and method of acquisition impact its contribution to knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person uses a broken thermometer that by chance gives the correct temperature. Intuitively, this true belief does not seem to contribute to genuine knowledge.**
