## Content

**Consider a dog that avoids a harmful plant because it senses the associated risk through instinct. The dog's behavior indicates a non-accidentally true belief about the plant's toxicity, yet intuitively we might hesitate to attribute explicit knowledge to the dog.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a certain level of cognitive processing or conceptual understanding often absent in non-human animals. This principle suggests that non-human animals might have non-accidentally true beliefs without knowledge.**
