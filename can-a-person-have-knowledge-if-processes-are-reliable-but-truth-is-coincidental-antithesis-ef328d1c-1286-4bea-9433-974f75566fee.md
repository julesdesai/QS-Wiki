## Content

**Suppose a person is in a situation where a generally reliable weather report suggests rain, yet, on this occasion, they forecast sun through a gut feeling rather than the weather report. It happens to be sunny, so the proposition is true. Intuitively, we may not attribute knowledge to them.**, **Consider an individual who disregards a reliable cognitive process like a weather report but still ends up with a true belief. This does not seem to align with our intuitive understanding of knowledge even if the belief is true.**
