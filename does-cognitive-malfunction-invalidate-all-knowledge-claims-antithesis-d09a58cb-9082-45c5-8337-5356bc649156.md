## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has been generally reliable with their cognitive faculties, but due to temporary malfunction they form one true belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that this true belief is knowledge or it is not. If we say it is not knowledge, we risk undermining the knowledge status of beliefs formed when faculties are not malfunctioning.**
