## Content

**Consider a situation where a historian knows a past event happened based on records and evidence. Intuitively, we would judge this as knowledge, but reimagining a counterfactual where records do not exist does not negate this knowledge.**, **The sensitivity requirement that a belief must not hold if the proposition were false conflicts with our intuitions about historical knowledge, which relies on the integrity of evidence and not on hypothetical falsity.**
