## Content

**An infinite chain of reasons is, by definition, unending and therefore cannot be fully grasped or completed by any individual.**, **If a person cannot fully grasp or complete a chain of reasons, it is implausible to claim they can possess knowledge based on that chain.**, **Supposing an infinite chain of reasons is necessary for justification creates a situation in which knowledge is practically inaccessible, posing a threat to the idea that we can have any knowledge at all.**
