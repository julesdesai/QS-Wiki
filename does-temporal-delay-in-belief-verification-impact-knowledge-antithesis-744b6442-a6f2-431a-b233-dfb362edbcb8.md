## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a justified belief about a current event based on an outdated report, but the report turns out to be true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the event occurred or that they do not know. If we say they know, the importance of timely justification is undermined. If we say they do not know, the viewâ€™s sufficiency criteria are brought into question.**
