## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on fallible evidence, and the proposition happens to be true by sheer coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively, we are reluctant to say the person knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, the truth of the belief should not depend on mere luck rather than reliable evidence. This principle together with fallibilism suggests that some true beliefs might not be considered knowledge despite being justified.**
