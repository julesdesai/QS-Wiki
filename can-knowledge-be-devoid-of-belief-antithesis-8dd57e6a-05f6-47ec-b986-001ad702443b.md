## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person acts correctly and successfully based on a series of instinctive reactions, without forming a clear belief about the relevant proposition. Intuitively, it seems they operate with a form of knowledge even in the absence of explicit belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can manifest in abilities or successful action without explicit belief.
