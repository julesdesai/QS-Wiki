## Content

**A situation involves an individual who predicts the outcome of a future event and believes it with confidence due to causally linked superstition or guesswork.**, **The event indeed occurs as predicted, making the belief true by coincidence rather than reliable causal support.**, **Such cases challenge whether causal support is sufficient for genuine knowledge, as the intuition suggests more factors are needed.**
