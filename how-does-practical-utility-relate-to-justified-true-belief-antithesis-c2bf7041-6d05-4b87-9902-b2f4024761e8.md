## Content

**A scenario where an individual believes a proposition that is true and justified, but believing the proposition has no immediate practical benefit, still seems to qualify as knowledge. This suggests that practical utility is not necessary for knowledge.**, **If justification, truth, and belief are present without practical utility, and the individual is still said to have knowledge, this suggests that practical utility is a redundant condition in the theory of knowledge.**
