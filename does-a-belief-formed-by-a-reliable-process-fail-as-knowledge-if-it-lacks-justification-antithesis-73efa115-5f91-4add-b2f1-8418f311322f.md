## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief using a reliable process they cannot justify or explain, such as a correct but mechanistic decision without understanding. Intuitively, we judge that such a belief lacks the status of knowledge.**, **A belief can be true and reliably produced but still not knowledge if the person cannot justify or understand the process.**
