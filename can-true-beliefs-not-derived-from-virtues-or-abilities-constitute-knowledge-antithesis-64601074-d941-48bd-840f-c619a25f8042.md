## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief about a proposition through sheer luck rather than an intellectual virtue or ability. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge despite the belief being true**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than the mere truth of a belief and the connection to intellectual virtues is questioned when luck plays a substantial role. This principle together with the reliance on luck suggests that a true belief not arising from intellectual virtue should not be considered knowledge**
