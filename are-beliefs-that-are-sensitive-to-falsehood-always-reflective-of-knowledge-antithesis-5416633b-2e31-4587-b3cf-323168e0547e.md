## Content

**There is a plausible principle suggesting that beliefs, though sensitive to falsehood, may still result from unreliable cognitive processes, which brings their status as knowledge into question.**, **Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on a cognitive bias that, while momentarily aligning with truth, predominantly leads to error. Intuitively, such sensitivity seems insufficient for true knowledge.**, **The sensitivity condition does not adequately distinguish between beliefs formed through systematic reliability and those susceptible to bias, indicating gaps in its knowledge criterion.**
