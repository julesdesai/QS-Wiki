## Content

**Consider a farmer who sees a barn and forms the belief "that is a barn". By chance, there are many fake barns around, but the belief is based on seeing the only real barn. Intuitively, the farmer does not have knowledge despite safety.**, **In nearly all nearby possible worlds, the farmer's belief is true, but the fortuitous reliability poses a challenge for the sufficiency of safety for claiming knowledge.**
