## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition because their cognitive faculties are functioning properly and the environment is suitable. Intuitively, we might find it unsatisfying if these conditions regularly result in merely lucky true beliefs rather than knowledge. If we accept that knowledge should not rely on luck, then an environment conducive to false positives challenges sufficiency.**
