## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **Knowledge requires justification involving an infinite chain modified by the specific demands of the decision context**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the context allows for flexible accommodation of an infinite justification chain**
