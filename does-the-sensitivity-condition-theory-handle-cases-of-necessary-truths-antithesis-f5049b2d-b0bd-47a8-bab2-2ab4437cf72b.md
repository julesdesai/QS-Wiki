## Content

**If a proposition is necessarily true, it cannot possibly be false, and thus the sensitivity condition cannot be tested.**, **Suppose someone believes a necessarily true proposition. Intuitively, they can still know it without the possibility of the proposition being false.**, **In the case of mathematical or logical truths, such as "2+2=4," it seems someone can know it without satisfying a sensitivity condition.**
