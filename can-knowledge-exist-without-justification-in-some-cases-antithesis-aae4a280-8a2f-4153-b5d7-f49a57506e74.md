## Content

**Imagine a situation where someone forms a belief that is true and could not easily have been false, but they have no justification for holding that belief. Intuitively, we would argue that the person does not actually possess knowledge, since justification is lacking.**, **The absence of justification in this scenario suggests that the safety condition, while necessary, is not by itself sufficient for knowledge.**
