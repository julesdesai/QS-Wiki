**A scenario in which a person wins a lottery and believes they will lose due to overwhelming odds is an example where their belief is false. In other nearby possible worlds where they have the same beliefs, they do not win. Intuitively, we would judge that they have knowledge of their actual loss despite false beliefs in similar scenarios due to overwhelming odds.**
