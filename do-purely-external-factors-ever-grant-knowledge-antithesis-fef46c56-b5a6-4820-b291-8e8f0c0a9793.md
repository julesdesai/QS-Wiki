**Imagine a scenario where someone, Tim, consults a reliable fortune teller, who unknowingly uses hidden technology to provide accurate predictions. Intuition might suggest Tim knows the future events accurately.**, **Despite Tim's belief being true and resulting in an apt outcome, his mental performance was not relevantly apt but instead reliant on external factors.**, **This implies that external factors alone can lead someone to have knowledge, challenging the necessity of the belief resulting from an apt mental performance.**
