## Content

**Scenario involves a person who forms a belief based on overwhelming evidence, making the belief very likely but not meeting the strict condition of being incapable of being false under nearby circumstances.**, **The belief is true and justified yet fails the sufficiency test for safety due to unlikely but possible errors.**, **This suggests that requiring that a belief could not easily have been false might exclude some intuitive cases of knowledge.**
