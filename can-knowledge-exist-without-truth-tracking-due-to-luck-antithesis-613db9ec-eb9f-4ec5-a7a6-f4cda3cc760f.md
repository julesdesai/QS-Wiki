## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a fortunate guess. In this scenario, the proposition is true due to an unusual coincidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition even though the belief is true and aligns with the truth across nearby possible worlds due to luck.**, **It is implausible that a belief which aligns with the truth merely due to a lucky coincidence could be considered knowledge.**
