## Content

**Imagine a person P who holds a largely coherent set of beliefs but includes one mistaken belief due to bad evidence. Intuitively, despite the overall coherence, the presence of an error undermines P's knowledge.**, **The presence of minor errors within a coherent belief system raises doubts about the sufficiency of coherence for knowledge.**
