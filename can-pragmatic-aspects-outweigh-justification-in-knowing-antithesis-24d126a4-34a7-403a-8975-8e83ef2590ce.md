## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Alex, has a true, justified belief about a particular medicine's effects, which is knowledge by the provided criteria. Now suppose Alex discovers, without additional justification, that the medicine is more pragmatically useful than previously thought, enhancing health beyond the initial scope. Intuitively, it seems Alex's knowledge is affected by the increased pragmatic usefulness, suggesting pragmatic utility can impact knowledge.**, **Pragmatic usefulness is described as non-essential for knowledge, yet there can be cases where practical considerations seem to enhance or diminish knowledge claims. This raises the question of whether pragmatic factors are truly non-essential or if they necessarily impact the validity of the knowledge claims.**
