## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief that a lottery ticket will lose based on the odds, even though they lack concrete evidence beyond probability. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not actually know the ticket will lose, even if their belief happens to be true.**, **In this scenario, the belief could not easily have been false in nearby possible worlds because the odds heavily favor the ticket's loss. Intuitively, the safety condition alone seems insufficient to account for the lack of knowledge.**
