## Content

**Consider a situation where during a debate on climate change, initial loose standards allow broad claims of consensus to be accepted as known. However, as evidence scrutiny tightens, only direct empirical support is satisfactory. The shift creates a contradiction, as claims once known might now fail to qualify as knowledge without being fundamentally altered.**, **This situation implies an implausibility in that knowledge assessment can be inconsistent or reversible by mere alterations in justification standards, rather than changes in evidence.**
