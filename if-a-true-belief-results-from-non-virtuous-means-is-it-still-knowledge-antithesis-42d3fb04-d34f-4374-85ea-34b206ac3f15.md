## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person gains a true belief through non-virtuous, but reliable methods, such as guessing from instinct or habit. In such a scenario, intuitively we might consider whether this represents knowledge or not.**, **There is a plausible principle stating that a true belief stemming from epistemically improper methods should not count as knowledge. This challenges the sufficiency of intellectual virtue alone.**, **If true belief emerging from non-virtuous behavior can still be considered knowledge, then intellectual virtue may not exclusively account for all knowledge cases.**
