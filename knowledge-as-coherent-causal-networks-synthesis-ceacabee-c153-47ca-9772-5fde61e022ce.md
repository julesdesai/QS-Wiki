## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true, without relying on false intermediary steps**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true, with each step in the causal chain being true**, **For knowledge to avoid regress, causal chains terminate in basic beliefs that are related through coherent networks of true beliefs, which do not require further causal explanation**
