## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person’s belief in a proposition tracks truth because in all relevant nearby possible worlds, although the methods change, the ultimate belief aligns with truth. Intuitively, we might need to say that the belief does not consistently track truth as methods vary.**, **A plausible principle is that tracking requires methods consistent across worlds. This, together with the potential variability in method effectiveness, challenges the idea of tracking sufficiency.**
