## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a mathematician produces accurate results without consciously believing in the propositions they work with due to altered states of consciousness. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the mathematician possesses knowledge of those results.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not always require conscious belief. This principle together with the claim that knowledge is obtained can entail that belief is not necessary for knowledge.**
