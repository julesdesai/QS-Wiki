## Content

**Suppose in a high-standard context, the epistemic criteria are so demanding that few, if any, beliefs qualify as knowledge. Intuitively, this creates a form of skepticism that seems overly restrictive.**, **It is implausible that everyday knowledge claims, which are often sufficient in low-standard contexts, should be invalidated purely by entering a high-standard context.**
