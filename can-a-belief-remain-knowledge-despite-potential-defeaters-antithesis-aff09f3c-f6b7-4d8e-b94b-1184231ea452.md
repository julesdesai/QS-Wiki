## Content

**Consider a case in which a person forms a true belief based on intellectual virtue and there exists potential, but not actual, defeaters that could undermine this belief. Intuitively, the idea that knowledge persists despite only potential defeaters seems plausible, which challenges the strict necessity of no defeaters for knowledge.**
