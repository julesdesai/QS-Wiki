## Content

**Consider a case where a child, Lucy, believes a historical fact because a teacher told her, without verifying it herself. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that Lucy knows the historical fact through testimonial knowledge, even if a direct causal chain between the historical event and her belief is not present.**
