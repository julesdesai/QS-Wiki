## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if justification requires an infinite chain with causal connections, then most beliefs would lack justification due to the impracticality of establishing such chains. This principle together with the claim that knowledge requires this kind of justification entails that knowledge is unattainable for most beliefs.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person firmly knows a commonly agreed fact like "the Earth orbits the Sun," yet is unable to establish an infinite causally connected justification for it. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the fact, creating tension with the implications of requiring infinite causal chains.**
