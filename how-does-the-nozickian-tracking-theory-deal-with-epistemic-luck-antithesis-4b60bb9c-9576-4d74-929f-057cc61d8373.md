## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes that a lottery ticket will lose, and it does lose. If they believed this due to cognitive biases rather than an analysis of probability, they might still satisfy Nozickian tracking conditions because they wouldn't believe it if it were true (they won), and they do believe it when it's true (they lost).**, **Intuitively, we would not grant that they have knowledge because the belief is formed by luck rather than a robust method.**, **Luck undermines the claim that the belief is sufficient for knowledge, casting doubt on the sufficiency of satisfying Nozickian tracking conditions.**
