## Content

**Suppose a person knows a generalization such as "All swans are white" based on numerous observations. Intuitively, we would judge this as knowledge, yet the belief would remain even if the proposition were false.**, **Sensitivity struggles with generalizations because it requires a belief that would not hold if false, yet empirical knowledge often persists even under hypothetical falsity.**
