## Content

**A case in which a person understands how a certain investment strategy works but applies it based on incorrect market predictions, leading to financial loss, is not a case of knowledge. There is a plausible principle that understanding a proposition requires the proposition to be objectively true for it to be known. This principle together with a false practical outcome entails a lack of knowledge.**
