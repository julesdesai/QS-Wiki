## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a reliable process, but the belief does not change when the proposition becomes false due to new information. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires that a belief must change when the proposition's truth value changes. This principle suggests that merely tracking truth in similar situations might not be sufficient for knowledge.**
