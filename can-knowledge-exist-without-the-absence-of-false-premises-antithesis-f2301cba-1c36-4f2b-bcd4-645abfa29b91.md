## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a chain of reasoning involving true premises and an unrelated false premise that is not essential to the conclusion. Intuitively, we might judge that the knowledge of the proposition is not undermined by the irrelevant false premise.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires justification based on essential premises. If a belief is based on essential true premises, then unrelated false premises might not invalidate the knowledge claim.**
