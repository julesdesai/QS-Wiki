## Content

**Suppose external conditions upon which a belief rests are constantly changing, causing fluctuations in what is taken as knowledge. Intuitively, we cannot label such belief as knowledge because it lacks stability.**, **For knowledge to be meaningful, beliefs must be robust against potential alterations in external conditions that affect their truth.**
