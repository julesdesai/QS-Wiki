## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justification is central to distinguishing knowledge from mere true belief. This principle together with the focus on sensitivity might prioritize a truth-tracking condition over justified processes.**, **In scenarios where justification alone tracks epistemic responsibility, intuitively, this strikes at the heart of sensitivity's sufficiency for knowledge.**
