## Content

**It is implausible that coherence defined by flexible context-specific factors alone can provide a robust and objective basis for knowledge. Knowledge typically involves some criteria resistant to changes in the context.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should remain stable across varying contexts. This principle together with an account that allows coherence to be sensitive to context-specific factors entails potential instability in what counts as knowledge.**
