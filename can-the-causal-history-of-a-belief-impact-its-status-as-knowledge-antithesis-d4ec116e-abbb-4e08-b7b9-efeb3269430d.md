## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person P sees a clock that is stopped but accidentally correct. P believes the correct time based on the clock and has justification due to the familiar reliability of clocks. Intuitively, P does not know the time as the clockâ€™s accuracy in this case is accidental.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires a non-accidental connection between belief and truth. This principle suggests that P's situation lacks knowledge due to the absence of an appropriate causal history.**
