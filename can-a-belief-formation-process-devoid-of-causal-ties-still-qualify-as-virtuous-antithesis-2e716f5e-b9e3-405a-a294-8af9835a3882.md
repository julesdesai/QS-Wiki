## Content

**It is implausible that every virtuous belief formation process successfully integrates a causal connection to the truth. This raises doubts about causal connections being essential to intellectual virtues.**, **Consider a case in which a belief is formed through a reliable source that does not directly causally interact with the truth. Intuitively, such a process could still be attributed to intellectual virtues.**
