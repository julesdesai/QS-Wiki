## Content

**Consider a classic Gettier case where a person forms a true belief through justification, yet in a manner leading to accidental truth. Intuitively, we judge this person lacks knowledge.**, **A belief formed by faculties functioning properly that results in an accidentally true belief suggests that proper function is not always sufficient for establishing knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, defined through proper function alone, accommodates scenarios where truth occurs by accident rather than through a direct connection to reality.**
