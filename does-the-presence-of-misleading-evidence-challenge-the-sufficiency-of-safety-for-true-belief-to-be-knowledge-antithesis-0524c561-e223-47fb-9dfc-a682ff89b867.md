## Content

**Suppose a person arrives at a true belief while in possession of misleading evidence against the truth of the proposition. Intuitively, it seems they do not have knowledge, as the misleading evidence suggests unreliability, even if their belief isn't easily false.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can exist simply based on safety conditions if a person holds their true belief contrary to what their evidence indicates.**
