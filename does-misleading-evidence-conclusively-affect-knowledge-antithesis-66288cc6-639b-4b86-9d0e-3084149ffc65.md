## Content

**Suppose a case in which a person knows a true proposition and is presented with misleading evidence, leading them to suspend their belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person lost knowledge during the suspension or that knowledge is unaffected by belief suspensions. If we say they lost knowledge, then they did not know continuously. If we say knowledge is unaffected, then misleading evidence has no impact on knowledge, which seems counterintuitive.**
