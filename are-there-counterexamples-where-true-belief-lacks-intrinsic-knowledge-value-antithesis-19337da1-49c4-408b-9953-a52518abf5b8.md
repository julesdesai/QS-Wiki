## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone believes a trivial truth, such as the exact number of grains of sand on a distant beach, without any potential relevance or use. Intuitively, such a belief does not possess inherent knowledge value beyond its trivial truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be valuable as knowledge, it must also be relevant or significant. This principle together with intuitions about trivial truths suggests that true belief in itself might not always constitute valuable knowledge.**
