**Consider a skeptical scenario where an individual is subject to massive deception, such as being in a simulated reality, and all their external beliefs are true only by chance. Intuitively, it would appear that their beliefs do not equate to knowledge.**, **A plausible principle claims that knowledge must be resilient to skeptical challenges, which external conditions alone might not ensure.**
