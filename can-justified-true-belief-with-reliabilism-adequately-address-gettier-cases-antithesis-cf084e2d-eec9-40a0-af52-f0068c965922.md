## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition because they have strong evidence that turns out to be incorrect, yet the proposition is true due to luck. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge despite having a justified true belief.**, **A reliable cognitive process might produce true beliefs in certain scenarios purely by chance, undermining the requirement for knowledge. These cases challenge the sufficiency of justified true belief with reliabilism.**
