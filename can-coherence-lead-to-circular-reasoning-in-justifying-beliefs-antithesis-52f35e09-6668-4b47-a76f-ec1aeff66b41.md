## Content

**Suppose a situation where coherence requires supporting beliefs that themselves rely on the belief in question, potentially leading to circular reasoning; intuitively, such circularity seems inadequate for knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a person's belief is considered coherent only because it's supported by other beliefs that equally depend on it, which threatens the robustness of coherence as a criterion for knowledge.**
