## Content

**Consider cases involving mathematical knowledge where the reliability of the cognitive process seems less relevant than logical deduction. Intuitively, we would judge that reliability does not contribute to understanding how one knows a mathematical truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge in areas like mathematics relies more on logical deduction than on process reliability.**
