## Content

**Suppose someone, Bob, has an unreliable cognitive process resulting in a true belief about a complex scientific fact without understanding it. Intuitively, Bob lacks knowledge despite the truth of his belief.**, **It is implausible to assert that beliefs formed by unreliable methods can constitute knowledge, even if they aren't true merely due to epistemic luck. This suggests that reliability or some other additional factor might be necessary.**
