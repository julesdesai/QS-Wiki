## Content

**Consider a situation where a person's belief is true because of a brief moment of reliability in an otherwise unreliable process. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the process to be reliably reliable, not just momentarily or accidentally reliable. This principle together with the situation suggests that the belief does not amount to knowledge.**
