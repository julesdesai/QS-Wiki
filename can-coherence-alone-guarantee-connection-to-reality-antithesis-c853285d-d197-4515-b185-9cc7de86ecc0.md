## Content

**Imagine a person maintains a tightly coherent belief system in a world simulated by computers (a virtual reality scenario). Intuitively, such coherence within a simulated framework doesn't provide actual knowledge of the real world.**, **A logical fact is that coherence within an isolated system does not guarantee the truth of beliefs about an external reality.**
