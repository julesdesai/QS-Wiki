## Content

**Suppose a person can doubt all past knowledge claims due to the fallibility of the justifications previously accepted as knowledge. Intuitively, this skepticism suggests they never really had knowledge.**, **A plausible principle states that knowledge should resist wholesale skepticism and remain reliable over time, contrary to what fallible justifications seem to allow.**
