## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for something to serve as a reliable criterion for knowledge, it needs objective measures. Intellectual virtue, characterized by qualities like honesty, creativity, and prudence, can be subjective.**, **Consider two scholars regarded as intellectually virtuous, but who apply subjective interpretations of reasonableness. Intuitively, the subjectivity raises doubts about whether their beliefs reliably constitute knowledge regardless of virtue.**
