## Content

**It is implausible that reliability alone determines knowledge, for example, in cases of clairvoyant perceptions where reliability is absent yet knowledge seems present.**, **An example is a clairvoyant who reliably predicts events without a normal evidence base. Intuitively, we may feel that this is knowledge despite the absence of traditionally reliable processes.**
