## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone believes a false proposition, such as "The Earth is flat," due to widespread misinformation but simultaneously holds justified true beliefs about celestial mechanics. Intuitively, we would judge that the person can still know specific truths despite believing the false proposition.**, **It is implausible that holding a single false belief automatically disqualifies all other beliefs from being knowledge.**
