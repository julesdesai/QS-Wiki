## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief that is true, but the causal explanation they believe to be responsible for its truth is incorrect. Intuitively, we judge that this belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires correct causal understanding. This principle suggests that mistaken causal explanations may invalidate claims to knowledge.**
