## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person guesses the correct answer to a question on a game show without any knowledge of the topic. Intuitively, we might say this person knows the answer because it is correct, yet the belief did not result from an exercise of epistemic virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a fact implies having some understandings or your belief is formed through reliable means. This principle suggests that mere lucky guesses should not qualify as knowledge.**
