## Content

**Envision a case where John believes that a certain horse will win a race, and he has good reasons to believe this based on expert analysis. The horse wins, but due to unexpected events like others falling. Intuitively, we might question whether John truly knows the horse would win.**, **Cases of epistemic luck undermine the sufficiency of justified true belief with conditions because the truth of the belief stems from luck rather than reliable justification.**
