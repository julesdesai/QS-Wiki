## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone believes in scientific consensus about climate change because they always tune into accurate scientific sources. Intuitively, the belief might still exist in possible worlds where evidence remains compelling though slightly different.**, **It is implausible to entirely tie the existence of beliefs to the truth conditions in all possible scenarios, limiting knowledge claims excessively.**, **Sensitivity conditions might unjustly eliminate genuine knowledge claims due to rigid criteria about possible truth variances.**
