## Content

**There is a potential problem if the sufficiency condition allows for arbitrary true beliefs resulting from proper cognitive function to always count as knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a belief is true and formed in accordance with proper functioning, yet is formed accidentally or without justification. Intuitively, one might judge this not to be knowledge.**
