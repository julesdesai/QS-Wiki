**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for basic beliefs to have finite non-repeating justifications, while complex beliefs can have infinite non-repeating justifications**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the justification structure respects the foundational requirement**
