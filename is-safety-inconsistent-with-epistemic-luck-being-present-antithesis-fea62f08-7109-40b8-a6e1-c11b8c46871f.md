## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition where, through expansive luck, all external factors align to make it true across nearby possible worlds, yet epistemic success is accidental. It seems unlikely that this is knowledge if the agent's role and understanding are irrelevant.**, **The presence of such strong forms of epistemic luck would render the belief not genuinely safe or known, exposing safety's insufficiency.**
