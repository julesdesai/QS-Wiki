**The sensitivity condition could imply skepticism in cases where beliefs held with high confidence, like beliefs in mathematical truths or scientific laws, are known, yet counterfactual scenarios where they are false are conceivable.**, **Consider someone who knows a mathematical truth proven by an expert but would irrationally believe it even if false; the sensitivity condition could then deny this is knowledge when it seems clear it is.**
