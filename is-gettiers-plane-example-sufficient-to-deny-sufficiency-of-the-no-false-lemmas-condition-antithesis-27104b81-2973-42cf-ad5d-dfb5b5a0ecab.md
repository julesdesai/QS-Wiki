## Content

**Consider the classic example where a person believes a colleague owns a Ford based on seeing the colleague drive a Ford, while unknowingly their colleague sold the car yesterday and rented one for today. Intuitively, the belief is based on true and justifiable premises yet does not amount to knowledge due to accidental correctness.**, **Suppose that a subsequent correct replacement for another colleague owning a Ford appears. Intuitively, though no false lemmas were used, mere chance denotes that this is not true knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a belief formed correctly by happenstance and not directly relying on falsehood could firmly count as knowledge without further inquiry.**
