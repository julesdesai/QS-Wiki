## Content

**Consider a case where a person reasonably believes a truth, unaware of a theoretical defeater that, if found, would discredit the belief but is unknowable.**, **Intuitively, the mere existence of such a defeater seems insufficient to deny knowledge, yet it might not align with expectations of epistemic security.**, **There is a plausible principle that unknowable defeaters should not count against knowledge claims, suggesting that knowledge might require reassessment.**
