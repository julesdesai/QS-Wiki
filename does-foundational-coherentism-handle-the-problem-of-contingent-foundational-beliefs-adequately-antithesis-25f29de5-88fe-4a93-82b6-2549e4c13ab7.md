## Content

**A foundational belief is one that does not require further justification.**, **Suppose we have a foundational belief that is true in the current context but could be false in other possible contexts. Intuitively, we would judge that foundational propositions should be necessarily true , not contingent.**, **Foundational coherentism potentially allows contingent beliefs to serve as foundational, which is problematic if these foundations can be undermined by new findings.**
