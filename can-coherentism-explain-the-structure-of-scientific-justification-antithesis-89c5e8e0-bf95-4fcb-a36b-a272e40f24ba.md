## Content

**Consider a scenario where scientific conclusions are drawn from empirical data, which often stands as basic justification. In such a scenario, intuitively scientific knowledge seems grounded in data, not coherence among theoretical beliefs.**, **A plausible principle is that scientific knowledge is often dependent on empirical data for justification. This principle together with justified coherence alone suggests coherentism may not adequately explain scientific justification.**
