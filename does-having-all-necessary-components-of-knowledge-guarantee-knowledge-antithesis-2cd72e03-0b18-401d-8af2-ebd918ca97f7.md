## Content

**Suppose we have a case where Linda believes it will rain today because she heard it from a usually reliable weather forecast. It is true because it will indeed rain, yet the forecast was actually an unintentional replay of yesterday's accurate prediction. Intuitively, Linda's belief is justified and true, but she does not truly know it will rain today.**, **In a situation where a person forms a belief based on typically trustworthy testimony that happens to be true for reasons independent of the testimony, intuitively this person does not have knowledge even though the belief is justified and true.**
