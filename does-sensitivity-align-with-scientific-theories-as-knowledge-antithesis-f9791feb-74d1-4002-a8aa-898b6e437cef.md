## Content

**Consider a scientist who knows a theory is correct via robust data and experimentation. Intuitively, such scientific knowledge stands firm even if belief in its correctness continues despite unexpected findings.**, **The sensitivity condition's need for a belief to not withstand potential falsity fails to capture scientific knowledge that embodies theories enduring through new challenges.**
[END]

This list of objections illustrates different conceptual challenges to the Sensitivity Theory of Knowledge, considering various forms of knowledge claims and possible counterexamples.
