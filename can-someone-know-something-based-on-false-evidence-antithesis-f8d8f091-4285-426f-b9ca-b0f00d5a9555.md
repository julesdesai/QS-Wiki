## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition based on justified but false evidence. If the proposition is true by coincidence, intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or they do not. If we say they know the proposition, this seems to allow false evidence in knowledge, which is problematic. If we say they do not know, then justification and truth are not sufficient for knowledge.**
