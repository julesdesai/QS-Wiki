**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification involves an infinite chain of reasons quantified probabilistically**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and probabilistic quantification of an infinite justification chain is achieved**
