## Content

**Suppose a case in which a person is in a world where a proposition is true and they believe it, but in most nearby possible worlds where the proposition is false, they would not believe it. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge of the proposition despite its truth-tracking status.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should remain robust across normal changes but may not be accurate under abnormal conditions like misleading environments. This principle entails that the truth-tracking condition might fail to capture all cases of knowledge under usual patterns of belief.**
