## Content

**Consider the scenario where a person needs to justify a belief and faces an infinite regress of reasons, without ever reaching a more basic, self-evident reason. Intuition may suggest that without reaching a foundational reason, the regress problem persists, undermining the strength of justification.**, **There is an epistemic principle that suggests justification should not fall into an infinite regress, as it may fail to ground a belief securely. This principle questions whether infinitism can truly solve the regress problem without appealing to foundationalism.**
