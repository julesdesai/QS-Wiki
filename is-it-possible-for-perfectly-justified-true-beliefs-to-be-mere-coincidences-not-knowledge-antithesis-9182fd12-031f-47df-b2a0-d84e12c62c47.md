## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where someone believes it will rain, based on weather forecasts, and it does rain as forecasted. However, unknown to them, the forecast was based on a faulty model, and the rain occurred by chance. Intuitively, we are inclined to say that they do not 'know' it will rain, even though their belief was justified and true.**
