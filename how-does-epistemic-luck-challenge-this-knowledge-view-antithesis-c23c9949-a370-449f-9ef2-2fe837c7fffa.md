## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person arrives at a true belief by sheer luck, and the lack of defeaters is coincidental rather than a result of justified reasoning.**, **Intuitively, such scenarios prevent ascribing knowledge because they lack the evidential support typically indicative of knowledge.**, **It seems implausible to regard such a fortuitously true belief as knowledge, given the absence of a non-luck-based basis.**
