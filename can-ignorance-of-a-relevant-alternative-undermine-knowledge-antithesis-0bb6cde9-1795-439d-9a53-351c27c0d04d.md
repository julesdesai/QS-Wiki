## Content

**Suppose a person sees a lifelike robot playing the violin from a distance and believes it's a human. Intuitively, their belief is mistaken if the robot is a relevant alternative.**, **In such a scenario, it is necessary for a person to distinguish a human from a robot to claim knowledge of seeing a human.**, **If a person cannot distinguish the lifelike robot from a human, despite the belief being otherwise justified and true, they lack knowledge of the proposition.**
