**Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief safely true now but new evidence could easily render the belief false. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the current safety of the belief does not guarantee knowledge due to potential changes in evidence.**, **A case in which a person believes the stock market will rise based on current trends but faces new regulations tomorrow is an example where future developments question the safety of the belief and its potential classification as knowledge.**
