## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition, there are no defeaters present, but the belief is formed through unreliable cognitive faculties, such as wishful thinking. Intuitively, this process makes us doubt whether the person possesses knowledge.**, **It is implausible to consider a belief formed through unreliable processes as knowledge solely due to the absence of defeaters.**
