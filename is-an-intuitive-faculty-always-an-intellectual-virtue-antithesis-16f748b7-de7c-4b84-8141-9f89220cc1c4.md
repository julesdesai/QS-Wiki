## Content

**Consider a case where a person has an intuitive sense that generally misleads but occasionally leads to true beliefs. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person doesnâ€™t have knowledge because the intellectual virtue is unreliable.**, **It is plausible that a stable and reliable faculty for producing true beliefs is required for an intellectual virtue. If a faculty is not reliably producing truth, it is hard to consider it a true intellectual virtue.**
