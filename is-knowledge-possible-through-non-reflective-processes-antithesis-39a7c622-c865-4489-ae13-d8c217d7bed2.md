## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone gains knowledge through intuitive or automatic processes rather than conscious intellectual effort, such as instantly recognizing a face or solving a problem unconsciously. Intuitively, we might judge that they know the solution but did not exercise intellectual virtue in the process.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can arise from non-reflective or automatic processes. This principle suggests that intellectual virtue is not necessary in all cases of knowledge.**
