## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, but the truth of the proposition is accidentally timed with the belief formation. Intuitively, such accidental timing suggests that the truth of the belief is not safely held across similar situations because the belief could easily have been false due to timing.**, **A case in which a person correctly predicts a rare earthquake due to a ground tremor they misinterpret is an example where the belief is true but seems unreliable due to chance.**
