## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a method regarded as reliable in their context but viewed as unreliable in another context. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the reliability of the method should not depend on the context to determine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should involve an objective standard of justification. This principle together with the variability of contextual standards entails that knowledge can vary in a problematic way.**
