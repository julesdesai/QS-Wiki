## Content

**There is a logical fact that any self-contained justification system must guard against circularity to maintain coherence. An infinite chain seems equally vulnerable to hidden forms of circularity.**, **Consider a sequence that is infinite and supposedly non-repeating. Intuitively, unchecked infinite chains may inadvertently resemble circular patterns, threatening validity.**, **It is implausible that human agents could perfectly construct or verify non-circularity in an infinite series of reasons.**
