## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief based on a network of cognitive processes that includes a false assumption that does not affect the truth of the belief. Intuitively, we would judge that despite the true belief, the false assumption undermines claims of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be traced to all true antecedents in the cognitive process. This principle suggests that with a false assumption in the process, the belief does not qualify as knowledge.**
