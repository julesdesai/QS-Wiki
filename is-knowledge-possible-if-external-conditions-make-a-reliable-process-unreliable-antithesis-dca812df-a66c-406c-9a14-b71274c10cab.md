## Content

**Suppose someone uses a normally reliable cognitive process, but unknown external conditions render it unreliable in a particular instance, and yet the belief happens to be true. Intuitively, this does not seem to constitute knowledge.**, **A belief produced under distorted conditions impacting reliability, though true, fails to be knowledge because the process was not reliable in that instance.**
