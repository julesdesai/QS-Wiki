## Content

**Suppose an expert makes a knowledge claim that satisfies high epistemic standards but is dismissed by a layperson who prefers lower standards in their context. If context allows such dismissals, legitimate and expertise-based knowledge could be overlooked.**, **If valuable knowledge is dismissed due to varying standards, it risks undermining informed discourse and expertise reliance.**
