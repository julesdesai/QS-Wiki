## Content

**Consider a person who claims to know a mundane, everyday fact, such as the presence of a chair in their living room. Intuitively, they know this even though there might be some outlandish scenarios where their belief would be false, which challenges the necessity of sensitivity in everyday knowledge.**, **Such everyday knowledge seems robust despite failure under far-fetched conditions, suggesting the sensitivity condition might be too strict or not universally applicable.**
