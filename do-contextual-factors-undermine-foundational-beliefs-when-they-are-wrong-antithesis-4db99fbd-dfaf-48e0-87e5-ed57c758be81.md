## Content

**Consider a situation where an anthropologist's belief in the cultural practices of a tribe is based on foundational beliefs about anthropology but the contextual background information they rely on is mistaken. Intuitively, we would judge that the anthropologist lacks knowledge about those practices.**, **There is a plausible principle that when contextual factors are wrong, they undermine the justification of foundational beliefs. This principle together with the impact of mistaken contextual information entails that foundational beliefs might not always be a reliable basis for knowledge.**
