## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a philosopher believes in an abstract ethical principle with no intention to apply it. Intuitively, either we accept they have knowledge of this principle or not. If we say they do have knowledge, practical aims seem unnecessary.**, **A case in which an artist believes entirely in their theory of aesthetics, which holds true and justified in context, challenges the necessity of practical aims for being considered knowledge.**
