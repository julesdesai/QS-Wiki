## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a clear causal connection between the belief and the fact. This principle together with the vagueness in determining causal links in complex scenarios entails that it might be challenging to ascertain knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person makes an accurate prediction based on a vague hunch, and this prediction turns out to be correct. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that despite the lack of a clear causal connection, the person still possesses knowledge.**
