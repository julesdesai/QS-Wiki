## Content

**Imagine a case where a person holds a belief about a scientific theory based on evidence they once encountered. Subsequently, new evidence arises that the person hasn't encountered, indicating the theory is false. Intuitively, the evolution of the evidence seems relevant to whether the person knows the theory, despite their original justified belief.**, **Knowledge seems to require update and responsiveness to new evidence, suggesting that relying solely on past evidence can be problematic if the evidence landscape changes. A belief cannot maintain its justified status if new, unconsidered evidence challenges it.**
