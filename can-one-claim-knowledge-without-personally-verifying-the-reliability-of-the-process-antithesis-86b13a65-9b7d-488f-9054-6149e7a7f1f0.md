## Content

**Suppose a person accepts a true proposition based on testimony from experts claiming access to a reliable process, yet the person does not verify the reliability themselves. Intuitively, there arises a concern whether unverified acceptance of reliability compromises the claim to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can exist where the individual has not personally confirmed the reliability, emphasizing autonomy in understanding over passive acceptance.**
