## Content

**Suppose a person believes, "The sky is blue when the weather is clear," and this belief is true and justified. The belief may have no particular practical consequence in certain contexts. Intuitively, we would say the person knows this proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that mundane or trivial truths can still constitute knowledge. This principle together with the necessity of practical consequence implies a misalignment with common intuition about trivial truths being knowable.**
