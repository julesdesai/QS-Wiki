## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief in a true proposition is a direct result of external manipulations or influences, bypassing personal intellectual virtues. Intuitively, we would judge that the knowledge claim is undermined despite the truth of the belief**, **A plausible principle is that autonomous engagement of virtues is necessary for knowledge, challenging the view that results alone are sufficient for knowledge designations**
