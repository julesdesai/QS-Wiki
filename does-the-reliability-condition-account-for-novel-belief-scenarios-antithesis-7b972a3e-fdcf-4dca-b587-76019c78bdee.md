## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief through a novel, untested process, deemed reliable only after the fact. Intuitively, we would judge that one does not have knowledge at the time of belief formation.**, **It is plausible that knowledge cannot be predicated solely on post-hoc validation of reliability.**
