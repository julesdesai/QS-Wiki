## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a reliable cognitive process that surprisingly yields a true belief without any internal justification, intuitively we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge because internal justification seems lacking.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing entails having internal access to reasons or justification for a belief. This principle together with the notion of reliable process alone suggests reliability might not be enough.**
