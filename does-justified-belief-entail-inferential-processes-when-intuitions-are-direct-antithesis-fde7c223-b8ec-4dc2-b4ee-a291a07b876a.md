## Content

**Consider a scenario where an artist, without formal knowledge of color theory, correctly understands the effects of color combinations simply through intuitive direct perception. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the artist knows how colors work.**, **There is a plausible principle that some forms of knowledge are acquired directly through intuition rather than inference. This principle together with the claim of direct knowledge of color effects entails the possibility of non-inferentially justified beliefs being considered knowledge.**
