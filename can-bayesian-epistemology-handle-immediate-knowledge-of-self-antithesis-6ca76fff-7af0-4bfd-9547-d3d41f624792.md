## Content

**Suppose a person has immediate introspective awareness of their own mental states, such as feeling pain. Intuitively, we regard this awareness as knowledge, despite the absence of probabilistic reasoning.**, **It is implausible that all self-knowledge involves alignment with probabilistic reasoning, as introspective knowledge is often direct and immediate.**
