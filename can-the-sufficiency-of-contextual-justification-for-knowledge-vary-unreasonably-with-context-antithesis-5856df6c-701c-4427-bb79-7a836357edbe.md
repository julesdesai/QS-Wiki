## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a scientist in a field achieves consensus based on a model, confident they have knowledge. If a layperson in another context with less stringent evidence standards believes the same due to media reports, both might claim knowledge. The difference in expertise suggests knowledge requires more than contextual sufficiency in lay contexts.**, **A principle asserting knowledge sufficiency can vary widely prompts intuitive concerns about the inappropriateness of accommodating layperson beliefs as knowledge in expert domains.**
