## Content

**Suppose a person holds a belief based on reliable processes and personal understanding, yet this understanding is inconsistent with the broader scientific consensus. Intuitively, this raises questions about whether personal understanding alone is sufficient for knowledge without consensus.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must align with collective understanding rather than just individual comprehension of reliability, challenging the sufficiency of personal insight.**
