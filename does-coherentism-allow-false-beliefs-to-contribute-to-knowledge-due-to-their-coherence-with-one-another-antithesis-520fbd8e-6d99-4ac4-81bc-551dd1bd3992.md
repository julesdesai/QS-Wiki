## Content

**Suppose a case where a person's belief system includes a number of false but mutually coherent beliefs. Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge to a system containing false beliefs, regardless of coherence.**, **A plausible principle is that false beliefs cannot contribute to genuine knowledge. This principle suggests that coherence, when involving false beliefs, does not suffice for knowledge.**
