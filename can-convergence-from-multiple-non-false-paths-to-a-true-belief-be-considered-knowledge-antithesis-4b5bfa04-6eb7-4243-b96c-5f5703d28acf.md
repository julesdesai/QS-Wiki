## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at a true belief through multiple lines of reasoning, each avoiding false lemmas, yet each independently offering limited assurance. Intuitively, we may judge that convergent reasoning does not solidly ground knowledge if these paths lack coherence.**, **A plausible principle suggests that coherence among justifications enhances knowledge attribution. This principle together with disparate non-false paths to belief entails that lack of coherence can undermine knowledge.**, **It is implausible to attribute knowledge when disparate reasoning paths fail to conclusively reinforce the belief due to lack of mutual support.**
