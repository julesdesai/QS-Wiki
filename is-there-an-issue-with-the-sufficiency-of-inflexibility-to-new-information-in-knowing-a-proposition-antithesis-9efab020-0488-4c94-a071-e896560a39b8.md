## Content

**Knowledge traditionally requires responsiveness to new and reliable information.**, **There can be cases where inflexible beliefs that resist change despite new information are seen as linked to dogmatism rather than knowledge.**, **The stipulation that inflexibility in belief despite reliable contrary evidence is sufficient for knowledge is thus counterintuitive to typical conceptions of knowledge.**
