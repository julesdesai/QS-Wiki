## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person asserts they know something in one context due to low standards, while they deny knowing the same thing in another context due to high standards. Intuitively, this presents a contradiction in the personâ€™s knowledge claims.**, **There is a principle that knowledge claims, when true, should not lead to contradictions based on changes in conversational context.**, **It is implausible that a valid knowledge claim in one context should become invalid merely by altering conversational stakes, as this could result in contradictory beliefs.**
