## Content

**Consider a scenario wherein a person believes a proposition through a generally reliable cognitive process that is nonetheless susceptible to known cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias. Intuitively, we might judge that susceptibility to bias undermines the knowledge claim, even if the belief produced is true.**, **It is implausible that reliable belief susceptible to biases can fully constitute knowledge, as biases introduce systematic errors that question reliability.**
