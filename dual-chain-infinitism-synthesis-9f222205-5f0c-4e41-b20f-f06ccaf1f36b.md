**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that justification involves a dual-chain of reasons where one chain is infinite and theoretical, and the other is finite and accessible**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and there exists a dual-chain of reasons justifying the belief**
