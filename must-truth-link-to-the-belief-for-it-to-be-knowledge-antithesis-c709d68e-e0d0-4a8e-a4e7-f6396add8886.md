## Content

**There is a plausible principle that truth must have a direct link to the belief for it to be knowledge. This principle together with coherentism entails that mere coherence without truth linking may not qualify as knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which someone has a highly coherent set of false beliefs. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know nothing or that coherence alone grants knowledge. If we say they know nothing, coherence isn't the only criterion. If we say coherence alone grants knowledge, we face the problem of false knowledge.**
