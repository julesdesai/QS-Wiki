## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person typically has a reliable cognitive process for forming beliefs, but in a specific case, that process leads to false beliefs due to unusual interference. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the reliability of the process is compromised.**, **There is a plausible principle that a reliable process should consistently produce true beliefs. This principle together with the scenario entails that the reliability criterion cannot account for all cases of knowledge acquisition.**
