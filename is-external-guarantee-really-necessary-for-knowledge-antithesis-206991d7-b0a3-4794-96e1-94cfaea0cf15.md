## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a true belief about a proposition without any external guarantee, perhaps through sheer luck. Intuitively, we might judge that the person has knowledge despite the absence of an external guarantee.**, **There is a principle suggesting that 'luck' can play a role in the acquisition of knowledge, as long as the belief remains true; thus challenging the necessity of an external guarantee.**
