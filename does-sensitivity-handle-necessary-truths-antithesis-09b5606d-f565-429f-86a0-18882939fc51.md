## Content

**Consider a necessary truth like "All bachelors are unmarried." Since it's necessarily true, the situation where it is false is impossible, thus making the sensitivity condition vacuous.**, **It seems strange or misleading to require that non-belief follows from the falsehood of a necessarily true proposition, as there is no possible world where it fails.**
