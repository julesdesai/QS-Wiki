## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition because of a reliable cognitive process, such as a birdwatcher identifying a rare bird species correctly because they have often seen similar birds. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that if the person holds relevant false beliefs about other similar-looking birds, these misleading experiences might undermine their reliability, calling into question whether the belief truly constitutes knowledge.**, **It is plausible that knowledge requires indefeasibility, meaning that knowledge should not be undermined or "defeated" by further information that the knower is unaware of. This entails that simply having a belief formed by a reliable process is not sufficient for knowledge if relevant defeaters exist.**
