## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual forms a belief based on solid evidence, and the belief is true. Meanwhile, in a nearby possible world, an error is introduced, but the original conditions still hold. It is implausible that the belief amounts to knowledge given the potential for mistake.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires robust truth across nearby possible worlds. This principle together with the possibility for easily made errors suggests that merely believing truly with justification is insufficient for knowledge.**
