## Content

**Imagine a skeptical scenario like a brain in a vat, where all beliefs are formed through deception. Intuitively, we may still grant knowledge to certain beliefs based on coherence or consistency, defying sensitivity.**, **Sensitivity demands beliefs would not hold if false, but in skeptical scenarios, the requirement doesn't fit how we evaluate day-to-day knowledge.**
