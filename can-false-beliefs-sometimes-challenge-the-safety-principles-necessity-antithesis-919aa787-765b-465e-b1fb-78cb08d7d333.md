**Suppose someone correctly believes that their friend is at the library based on a false belief that they saw their friend's car there; in reality, the car is identical but unrelated. Intuitively, it seems they might not truly know their friend is at the library.**, **This belief, even if true, may not adequately track the truth if based on coincidences or misinformation.**, **In nearby possible worlds, their belief could easily have been false if the unrelated car wasn't present.**
