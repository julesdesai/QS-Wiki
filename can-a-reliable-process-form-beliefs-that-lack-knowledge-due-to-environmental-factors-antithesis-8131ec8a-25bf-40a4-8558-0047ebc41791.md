## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual forms a belief using a reliable process in an environment that contains many misleading and unreliable factors. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the belief does not constitute knowledge despite the true belief and reliability of the process.**, **A cognitive process may be reliable in general but become unreliable in certain environments, leading to true beliefs that seem not to qualify as knowledge.**
