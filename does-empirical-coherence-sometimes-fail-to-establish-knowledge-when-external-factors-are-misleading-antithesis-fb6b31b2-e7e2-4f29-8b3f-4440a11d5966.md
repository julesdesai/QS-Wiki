**Consider a situation where a person's system of interconnected beliefs, including empirically validated beliefs, is influenced by misleading external evidence, causing a coherent but false understanding of a situation.**, **In this case, although the person's belief coheres and aligns with empirical evidence, intuitively we would not say that the person has knowledge due to the deceptive nature of the external evidence.**
