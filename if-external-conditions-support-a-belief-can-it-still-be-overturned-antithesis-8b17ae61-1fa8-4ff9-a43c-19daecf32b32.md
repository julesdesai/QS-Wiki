## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition on external conditions that protect it from immediate defeasibility but a technological failure later reveals these conditions were misrepresented. Intuitively, these revelations exclude the person from truly knowing the proposition.**, **Knowledge requires that external conditions should remain reliable across time, making revisions necessary if conditions are later found to be unreliable.**
