## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a belief system is coherent but contains hidden contradictions that are not immediately apparent. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the presence of contradictions undermines the system's reliability and justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that a genuinely coherent belief system cannot contain contradictions, as contradictions challenge internal consistency. This principle together with the possibility of unnoticed contradictions within an apparently coherent system entails that coherence alone is not sufficient for justification.**
