## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs, but the standards for knowledge in the context are not met. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **The necessity of meeting contextual standards implies that a belief satisfying other conditions without meeting context is insufficient for knowledge.**
