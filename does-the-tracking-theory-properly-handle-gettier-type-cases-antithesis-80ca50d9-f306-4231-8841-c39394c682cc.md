## Content

**Consider a scenario where Tom sees a barn in a field and believes "There is a barn in the field." This is true, and he believes it.**, **Suppose in nearby possible worlds, there are only convincing fake barn facades and no real barns; Tom would still believe he sees a barn.**, **It is implausible to claim that Tom knows there is a barn despite meeting Nozick's tracking conditions when his belief is accidentally true due to the presence of real barn.**
