## Content

**Knowledge claims often vary with the context, such as in low-stakes versus high-stakes situations, yet the safety condition seems too rigid to adapt to this variance.**, **The condition of safety may not account for how different circumstances affect whether we attribute knowledge to a person.**, **If contextual factors are disregarded, the safety condition could conflict with how ordinary knowledge is attributed and understood in varying scenarios.**
