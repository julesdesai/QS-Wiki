## Content

**Suppose someone acts based on what they claim is knowledge in a low-standard context, resulting in a harmful outcome when evaluated by high-standard epistemic criteria. If context determines knowledge, then judgments about ethical responsibility might vary unfairly.**, **If varying standards influence judgments of knowledge and consequently responsibility, it might allow individuals to evade moral accountability by appealing to different contexts.**
