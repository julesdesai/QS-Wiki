## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition, but they are ignorant of a relevant defeater they could have discovered with accessible evidence.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not possess knowledge if there is a known means to acquire information that would defeat the belief.**, **It is implausible that ignorance of easily accessible defeaters should suffice for knowledge.**
