## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a tree on the horizon and believes it is real. In most nearby possible worlds, what they see is actually a deceptively realistic cardboard cutout, leading to a false belief. Intuitively, the truth in the actual world seems accidental, suggesting the person does not truly know there is a tree based on their vision.**, **In this scenario, although the person believes the proposition and it is true in the actual world, the proposition is false in most nearby possible worlds, challenging the notion of knowledge based on safety in truth across nearby worlds.**
