## Content

**Suppose a person correctly believes the time based on a clock, unaware of a time zone change. Intuitively, leaving a time zone doesn't affect the clock's belief output, so the belief isn't sensitive.**, **If knowledge requires environmental sensitivity, unaware changes leading to false beliefs indicate problems for the sensitivity condition.**
