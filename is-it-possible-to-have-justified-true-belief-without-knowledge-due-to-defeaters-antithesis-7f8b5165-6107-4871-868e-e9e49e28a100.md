## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified belief that a friend is at home because they saw them through the window. Intuitively, we judge that they do not know this if there is an unnoticed defeater, such as the friend having a twin at home instead.**, **There is a principle suggesting that knowledge requires the absence of defeaters that undermine justification, even if the belief is true.**
