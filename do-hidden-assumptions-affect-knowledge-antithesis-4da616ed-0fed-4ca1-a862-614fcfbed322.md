**Consider a case in which someone's belief system includes hidden, erroneous assumptions that support a true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a hidden assumption would have been a defeater if known, then it undermines knowledge even when unknown.**, **Intuitively, one would judge that the presence of hidden defeater assumptions undermines the status of knowledge.**
