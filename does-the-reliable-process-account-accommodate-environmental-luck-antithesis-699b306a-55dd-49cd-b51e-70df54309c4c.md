## Content

**Suppose a person forms a true belief through a generally reliable process under specific circumstances that are not indicative of normal conditions, resulting in a true belief out of environmental luck. Intuitively, we would be hesitant to grant genuine knowledge in such cases.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should be robust across various situations, not merely contingent on a fluke of circumstances, challenging the notion that reliable processes always suffice.**
