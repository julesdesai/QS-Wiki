## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a longstanding belief in a scientific hypothesis due to personal bias. Eventually, the hypothesis is verified and the belief is true and safe from being easily false in future similar circumstances.**, **Intuitively, we might say that the person doesn't possess knowledge because the belief arose from entrenched, non-rational commitment rather than intellectual virtue.**, **It seems implausible to label entrenched beliefs as knowledge even when they finally align with truth and safety.**
