## Content

**Consider a scenario where two people are discussing the existence of an object, and both intuitively require different standards of justification to claim knowledge of its existence. This leads to a situation where either person can claim to "know" based on their contextual standard, suggesting inconsistency between what counts as knowledge.**, **It is plausible to believe that knowledge should not be variable with context, as truth and justification should be objective. The variability of justification standards based on context challenges the universality of knowledge claims.**
