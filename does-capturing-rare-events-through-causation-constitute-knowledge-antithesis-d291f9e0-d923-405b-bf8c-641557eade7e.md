## Content

**Suppose we have a rare natural phenomenon observed once, which results in a correct belief about that event. Intuitively, the unusual nature of causal evidence might suggest uncertainty in claiming knowledge of rare occurrences.**, **Rare events with causal links might still produce knowledge claims hindered by their exceptionalism rather than systematic causation.**
