## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition because of a malfunction in their cognitive faculties. Intuitively, we would still say that the person knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that if someone forms a true belief about a proposition by sheer luck, they do not have knowledge. This principle together with the definition of knowledge suggests that knowledge depends on more than just proper cognitive functioning.**
