## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a reliable cognitive process, but the belief is true only by coincidence. Intuitively, such a belief does not seem to qualify as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to qualify as knowledge, it must not only be true and reliably formed, but also non-accidental. This principle suggests that reliability alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
