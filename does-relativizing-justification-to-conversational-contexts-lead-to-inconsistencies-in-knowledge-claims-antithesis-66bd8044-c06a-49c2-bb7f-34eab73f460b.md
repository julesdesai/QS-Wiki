## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person claims to know a fact in one conversational context, but in another context, this claim is not justified. Intuitively, it seems the person both knows and does not know the fact.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be consistent across different conversational contexts.**, **A case in which the consistency of knowledge is compromised challenges the reliability of relativizing justification to conversational contexts.**
