## Content

**Consider a person who repeats a true statement in a foreign language they do not understand. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not know the proposition, as comprehension seems necessary for knowledge, even if the belief cannot easily be false.**, **There is a plausible principle that understanding plays a vital role in knowledge, indicating that mere immunity to falsity alone does not suffice for true belief to become knowledge.**
