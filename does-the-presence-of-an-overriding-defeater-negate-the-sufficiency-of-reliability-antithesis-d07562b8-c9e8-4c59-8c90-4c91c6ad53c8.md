## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief based on a reliable news source, but subsequently receives credible evidence that strongly suggests the source was compromised on the relevant occasion without actually affecting this particular fact. Intuitively, we question whether the belief still counts as knowledge.**, **Even if a belief is formed by a reliable process, the presence of a reasonable defeater should prevent us from attributing knowledge.**
