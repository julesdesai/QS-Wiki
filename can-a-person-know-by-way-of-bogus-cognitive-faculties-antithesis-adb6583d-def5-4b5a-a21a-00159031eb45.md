## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief using a faulty cognitive faculty, yet the belief happens to be true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person has knowledge because their belief is true, or that they lack knowledge due to unreliable cognitive function. If we say they have knowledge, then faulty methodologies could lead to genuine knowledge. If we say they lack knowledge, then reliable faculties are necessary for genuine knowledge.**, **A person consults a clairvoyant claiming to be able to predict future stock prices and believes this prediction, which turns out to be true, though the prediction was based on no reliable method.**
