## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people believe the same true proposition with equal justification. Intuitively, one person can know the proposition while the other does not because they are in different contexts with different standards for knowledge.**, **This suggests that knowledge could vary not because of the belief, truth, or justification, but because of different contextual standards, which seems to challenge the idea of objective knowledge.**
