## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alice, claims to know the bus arrives at 3 PM based on one schedule she saw once. In this context, Alice believes the bus arrives at 3 PM, and it is, in fact, true.**, **In such a scenario, the context-specific standards for knowledge could be very low, making it implausibly easy for Alice to claim knowledge without sufficient justification.**, **It is implausible that simply meeting these low context-specific standards suffices for genuine knowledge, as it undermines the robustness typically required for claiming knowledge.**
