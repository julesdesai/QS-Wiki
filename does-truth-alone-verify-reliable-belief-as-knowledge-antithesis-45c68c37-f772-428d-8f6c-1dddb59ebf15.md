## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, the cognitive process is reliable, and the proposition is true, but the person has no access to or awareness of the truth. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, as they lack understanding or insight.**, **It is implausible that reliable belief alone, without awareness of justification or understanding, qualifies as knowledge, even if it is true.**
