## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a hermit named Carl has developed a comprehensive and coherent belief system based on fictional books without any direct contact with the world. Intuitively, we either have to say that Carl knows the propositions within the system because of coherence, or he does not know them due to lack of contact with the world. If we say Carl knows these propositions, then it challenges the requirement for empirical connection to reality in knowledge. If we say Carl does not know them, then it implies coherence is insufficient for knowledge.**
