## Content

**Consider a scenario where the context of a bank's opening hours changes between what an employee tells a customer and what the customer sees online. In such a scenario, it seems counterintuitive for us to say that the customer both knows and does not know whether the bank is open based solely on different contexts.**, **Suppose the customer believes the bank is open due to the employee's claim and it is true. Intuitively, unless some vital information changes, it should not matter what additional context is given; the fact should remain consistent.**
