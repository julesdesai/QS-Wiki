## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition solely due to a fortunate guess or coincidence. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the truth or that they do not. If we say they know, then the notion of knowledge becomes too permissive. If we say they do not know, then knowledge requires more than internal justification and truth.**
