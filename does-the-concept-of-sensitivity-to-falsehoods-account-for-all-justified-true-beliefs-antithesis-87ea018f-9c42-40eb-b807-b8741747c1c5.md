## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge must account for all justified true beliefs, but sensitivity does not encompass every scenario of justified belief when truth is contingent on factors beyond sensitivity.**, **Consider a case where a justified belief results in truth due to speculation rather than evidential support. Intuitively, this should not count as knowledge, suggesting that sensitivity is insufficient in such instances.**, **Beliefs that are accidentally or speculatively true challenge the requirement of sensitivity, as these beliefs do not rely on a counterfactual relationship to truth, which is a key part of knowledge.**
