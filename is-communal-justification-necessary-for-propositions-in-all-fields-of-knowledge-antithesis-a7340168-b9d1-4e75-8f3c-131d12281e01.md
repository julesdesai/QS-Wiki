## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a scientist independently verifies a scientific truth using rigorous methods without engagement with communal epistemic norms. Intuitively, we might judge that the scientist knows the proposition without communal justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that some fields, like mathematics or empirical sciences, allow for individual knowledge without requiring communal epistemic norms.**
