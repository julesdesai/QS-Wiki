## Content

**Imagine a situation where a researcher holds a scientifically justified belief about a phenomenon. When this belief is tied to successful technological applications, the pragmatic successes seem to strengthen the belief's justification beyond empirical evidence alone. Intuitively, the pragmatic outcomes and empirical justification seem interdependent.**, **If justification must stand independently of pragmatic usefulness, then any influence or enhancement of justification through practical success challenges the independence of justification as required for knowledge. This raises questions about the purity of justification as a criterion.**
