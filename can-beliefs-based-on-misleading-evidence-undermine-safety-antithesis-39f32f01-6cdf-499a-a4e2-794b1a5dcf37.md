## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alice, forms a belief based on misleading evidence but in a nearby possible world the belief turns out to be true, which makes her belief unsafe. In this scenario, intuitively we would judge that the belief is not safe.**, **It is plausible that if a belief is formed based on misleading evidence but happens to be true due to chance circumstances, it does not qualify as knowledge.**
