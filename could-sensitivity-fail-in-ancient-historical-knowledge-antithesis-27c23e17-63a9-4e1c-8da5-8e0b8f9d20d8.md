## Content

**Suppose we have historical knowledge about a long-gone civilization deduced from artifacts and records. Intuitively, we must assume these accounts as knowledge despite no changing belief under false circumstances since the events cannot be re-evaluated or observed.**, **With knowledge rooted in irreversible past events, sensitivity fails to address beliefs grounded in historical cases where counterfactual evaluation is not possible.**
