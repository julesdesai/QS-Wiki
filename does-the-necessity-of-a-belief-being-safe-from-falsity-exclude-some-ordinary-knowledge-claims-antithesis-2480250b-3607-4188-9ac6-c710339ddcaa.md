**Ordinary beliefs about everyday occurrences like, "the sun will rise tomorrow," typically deemed knowledge, might not align with absolute safety due to unforeseen catastrophic events**, **If we require absolute safety from being false, many ordinary beliefs considered as knowledge could be rendered inadmissible**, **This questions whether the sufficiency of safety encompasses all or if it narrows the scope of traditional knowledge claims unwarrantedly**
