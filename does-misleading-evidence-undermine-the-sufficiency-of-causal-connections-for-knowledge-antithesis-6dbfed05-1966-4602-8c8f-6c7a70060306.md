## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief through misleading evidence that, coincidentally, leads to a true belief. Intuitively, the belief does not constitute knowledge despite a causal link.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable evidence is essential for knowledge. This principle suggests misleading evidence damages the claim to knowledge despite causal sufficiency.**
