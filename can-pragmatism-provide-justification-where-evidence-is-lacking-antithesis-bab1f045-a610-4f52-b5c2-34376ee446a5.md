## Content

**Envision a case where a community adopts a belief that has minimal empirical evidence but serves their pragmatic needs excellently, such as a cultural conviction that fosters social harmony. In this case, the belief's justification through empirical means is weak, yet it fulfills a pragmatic role convincingly.**, **If pragmatic usefulness implies some level of justification or strengthens the perception of justification, even when evidence is weak, it complicates understanding justification's role in knowledge by allowing practical effects to serve as a de facto form of justification.**
