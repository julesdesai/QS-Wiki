## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition because of evidence available in one context, but in another context, the evidence is insufficient. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person both knows and does not know the proposition across contexts.**, **The variability of contexts could lead to conflicting knowledge claims where one context justifies a belief while another does not, making it implausible for knowledge to consistently be defined by context.**
