## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a true belief formed in a casual, low-stakes context, such as a trivial conversation about the weather. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the person actually possesses knowledge despite the low stakes.**, **There is a plausible principle that if someone possesses knowledge in a low-stakes situation, they should still be able to possess knowledge when similar true beliefs are formed in other trivial contexts.**
