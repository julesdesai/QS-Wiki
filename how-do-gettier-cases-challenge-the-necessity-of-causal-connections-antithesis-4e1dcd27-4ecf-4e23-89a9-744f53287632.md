## Content

**Suppose Sam believes a colleague owns a Ford based on seeing them driving one. The colleague no longer owns it, but coincidentally, Sam's belief ends up true because another colleague just bought one. Intuitively, Sam does not have knowledge despite justified true belief and a causal connection to a past truth.**, **Gettier cases, like this, show that causal connection alone may not secure knowledge if additional misleading elements are present.**
