## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than merely having a true belief due to intellectual virtue. This principle, together with the possibility of acquiring true beliefs accidentally or by luck, entails that someone could meet these conditions without genuinely possessing knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where someone forms a true belief about a complex mathematical theorem by guessing. Despite the accidental truth of the belief, intuitively, it seems incorrect to claim that this person possesses knowledge.**
