## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes they are communicating with an invisible entity due to a trustworthy delusion. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows they are communicating with the entity or deny that they possess knowledge. If we say they know, it conflicts with the sensitivity requirement because if it weren't true, the person wouldn't disbelieve it. If we deny knowledge, it conflicts with our intuition that justified true beliefs in some cases constitute knowledge.**
