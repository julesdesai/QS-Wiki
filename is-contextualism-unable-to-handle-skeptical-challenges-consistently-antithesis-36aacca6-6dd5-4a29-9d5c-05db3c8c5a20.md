## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a theory of knowledge should consistently address skeptical scenarios, such as the possibility of being deceived.**, **In a skeptical context, the standards required for knowledge are often so high that almost no knowledge claims are valid. Intuitively, we would judge that this seems to invalidate everyday knowledge claims.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be so easily lost simply by shifting context to include skeptical considerations.**
