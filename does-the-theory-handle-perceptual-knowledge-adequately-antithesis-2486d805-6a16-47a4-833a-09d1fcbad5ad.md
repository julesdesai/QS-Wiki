**In cases of perceptual knowledge, such as seeing a tree, sensitivity might not be adequately tested without extreme scenarios.**, **Intuitively, perception gives direct knowledge, even when it is hard to conceive counterfactual situations that test sensitivity.**, **Suppose a person reliably distinguishes trees by sight; sensitivity to false appearances may not be a practical requirement for their knowledge.**
