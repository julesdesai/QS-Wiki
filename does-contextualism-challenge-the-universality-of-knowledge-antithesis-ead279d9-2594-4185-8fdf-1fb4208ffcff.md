## Content

**If knowledge is contingent upon conversational context, then what counts as knowledge in one culture or community may not count as such in another, undermining the universality of certain claims to knowledge. Intuitively, this is problematic for universally accepted knowledge such as scientific facts.**, **A principle of knowledge asserts that there are certain propositions whose truth or knowability should not be subject to variation across different conversational contexts.**
