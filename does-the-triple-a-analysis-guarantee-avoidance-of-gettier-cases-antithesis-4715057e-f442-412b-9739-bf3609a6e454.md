## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a belief is true, apt, accurate, and adroit, yet the reasoning process includes a lucky guess that just happens to be correct. Intuitively, we would say the person does not truly know the proposition.**, **If a belief can satisfy the Triple A conditions but still depend on luck, this challenges the sufficiency of these conditions for knowledge.**
