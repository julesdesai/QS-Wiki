## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person remembers a fact they previously verified through correct reasoning but has since forgotten the reasoning. The fact remains true and their belief is safe since similar situations do not easily make it false.**, **Intuitively, we might judge that the person no longer knows the fact because they cannot recall the intellectual virtue used to confirm it.**, **Even though the belief meets conditions of truth and safety, the lapse in intellectual virtue recall makes the knowledge attribution questionable.**
