## Content

**Suppose we have a case where an isolated belief is true and justified but stems from an unreliable process that accidentally works this one time. Intuitively, we might judge that the person knows the proposition, albeit it's produced by an unreliable process.**, **A case involving an isolated reliable belief formed by chance implies that reliability isn't strictly necessary for knowledge.**
