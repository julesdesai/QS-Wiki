## Content

**Suppose a person has a coherent set of beliefs about astrology that does not connect with any empirical beliefs. Intuitively, this coherence does not seem to confer knowledge given the lack of empirical connection.**, **A logical fact is that a belief system can be internally consistent yet entirely separate from reality. This disconnect indicates coherence might not be sufficient for knowledge.**
