## Content

**Consider a scenario wherein a person randomly guesses the correct answer to a complex scientific question without any prior knowledge or reasoning. The belief is true and not inferred from falsehood, yet intuitively, we hesitate to call this knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should exclude beliefs that are true merely by chance, which raises doubts about the sufficiency of true belief alone.**
