## Content

**Consider a case where a scientific community's consensus shifts as new evidence arises, thus changing the previously accepted truth. In this case, while the belief was part of a socially validated system, it was not in alignment with objective truth.**, **A plausible scenario involves a belief's status changing over time as systems evolve and develop better methods for truth-tracking, indicating that a belief being true in the social context does not guarantee that it matches objective reality.**
