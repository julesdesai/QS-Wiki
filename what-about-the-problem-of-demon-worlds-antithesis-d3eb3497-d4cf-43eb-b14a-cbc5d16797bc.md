## Content

**Suppose that a person is in a demon world where all their perceptual experiences are systematically deceptive due to the intervention of a malicious demon. Nevertheless, the person forms beliefs based on these experiences, and occasionally, these beliefs happen to be true by sheer luck. Intuitively, it seems that the person lacks knowledge in such a scenario, despite having beliefs that were formed by the most reliable process available in their deceived environment.**, **Even if a process is the most reliable available in a deceptive environment, it can still fail to produce knowledge because the beliefs it generates are true merely by accident.**
