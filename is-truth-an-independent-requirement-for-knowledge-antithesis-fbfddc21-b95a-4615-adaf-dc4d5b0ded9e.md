## Content

**Imagine a person believes a proposition that is supported by strong, defeasible justification, but the proposition happens to be false without their knowledge. Intuitively, they seem to have good reason to hold the belief, yet it does not count as knowledge due to its falsehood.**, **This scenario suggests that the truth of the proposition is an independent and necessary condition for knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of having only true belief with defeasible justification.**
