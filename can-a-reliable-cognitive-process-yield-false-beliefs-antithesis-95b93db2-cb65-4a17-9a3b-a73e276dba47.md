## Content

**Consider a situation where a reliable cognitive process is subject to unusual interference, resulting in false beliefs. This demonstrates that reliability does not always ensure true beliefs.**, **For a belief to qualify as knowledge, the reliability of the process must consistently produce true beliefs across all relevant situations.**, **Even if a process is generally reliable, knowledge should not be granted in cases where specific interferences lead to false beliefs.**
