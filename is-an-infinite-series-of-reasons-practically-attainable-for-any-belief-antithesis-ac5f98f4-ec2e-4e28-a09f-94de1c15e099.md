## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a true belief about a simple fact, like knowing their own name. This series of non-repeating reasons would need to be infinite to qualify as knowledge. It seems practically unattainable for a person to have an infinite series of reasons for such a mundane belief. The requirement for an infinite series seems to imply that knowledge is unattainable for such basic beliefs.**
