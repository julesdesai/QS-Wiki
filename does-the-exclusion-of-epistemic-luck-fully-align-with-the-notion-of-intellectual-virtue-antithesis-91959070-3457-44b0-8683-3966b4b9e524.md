## Content

**Think of a case where intellectual virtue guides a person to a true conclusion, but a small aspect of epistemic luck is still present, as in cases of expert intuition. Intuitively, one might suggest that knowledge could still be present even with a trace of luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be achieved without epistemic luck. This principle combined with traces of luck during knowledge formation suggests that complete exclusion of luck is not necessary for knowledge.**
