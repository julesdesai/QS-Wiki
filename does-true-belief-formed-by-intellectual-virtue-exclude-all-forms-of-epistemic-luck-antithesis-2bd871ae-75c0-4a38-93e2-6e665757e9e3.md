## Content

**Consider a situation where a student studies extensively and employs all robust learning techniques but only guesses the correct answer on an exam by chance. Intuitively, they would be credited with intellectual virtue, yet knowledge is not ascribed because the truth resulted from guessing.**, **A heuristic principle is that epistemic luck should not factor into what qualifies as knowledge. In the guessing scenario, true belief and intellectual virtue coincide, but the knowledge attribution is nullified by luck.**
