## Content

**A belief system can be coherent internally but still be disconnected from reality, leading to false beliefs.**, **A person can have a coherent belief system that systematically misinterprets sensory input due to faulty foundational beliefs yet still be seen as coherent.**, **If coherence with other beliefs in the system does not ensure the truth of those beliefs, coherence alone is insufficient to guarantee knowledge.**
