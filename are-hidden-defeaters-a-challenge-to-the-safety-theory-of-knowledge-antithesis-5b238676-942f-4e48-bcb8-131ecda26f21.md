## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a true belief and in nearby worlds their belief remains true; however, there exists hidden evidence that could defeat the truth of the proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition because of the potential overturning of their belief.**, **Knowledge seems to require handling all potential defeating evidence, which proximity of worlds can't always guarantee.**
