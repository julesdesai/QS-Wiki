## Content

**Consider a case where a person knows that they know a certain fact, like the location of their car. Intuitively, we say they have knowledge about their own knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that higher-order knowledge entails that sensitivity must apply not only to the original proposition but also to knowledge claims themselves. This leads to the requirement that sensitivity to second-order propositions is necessary, which seems overly demanding.**
