## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition based on reliable external processes that are unknown to them. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition due to the reliability of the process or that they do not know due to lack of conscious access. If we say they know, then the internalist's requirement of conscious access is unsatisfactory. If we say they do not know, then we deny the role of reliable processes in forming knowledge.**, **There is evidence showing that external processes often contribute to the formation of true beliefs, challenging the necessity of internal access to justification.**, **It is implausible that internal access to justification can account for all instances of knowledge, particularly those where external factors play a significant role.**
