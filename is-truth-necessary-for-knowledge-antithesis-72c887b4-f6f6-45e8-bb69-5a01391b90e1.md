**Imagine a scenario where a person has a justified belief in a proposition that is false, such as a scientist holding a theory supported by current evidence that is later overturned by new discoveries.**, **In such a case, intuitively we might say the person "knew" the proposition at the time based on available justifications, questioning the necessity of truth for knowledge.**
