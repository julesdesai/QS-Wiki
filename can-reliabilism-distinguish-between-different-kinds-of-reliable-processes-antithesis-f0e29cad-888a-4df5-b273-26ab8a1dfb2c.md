## Content

**Suppose a person uses an unreliable clock to form a true belief about the time, but by coincidence, their belief happens to be true because the clock was accidentally set correctly that day. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge or they do not. If we say they have knowledge, then the unreliable process seems unjustified. If we say they do not, then accidental reliability is not sufficient for knowledge and challenges the sufficiency of reliability alone.**
