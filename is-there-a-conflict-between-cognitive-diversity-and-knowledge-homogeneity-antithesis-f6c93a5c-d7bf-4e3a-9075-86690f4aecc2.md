**Suppose we have people with different cognitive designs due to genetic diversity, each forming true beliefs in their own proper environments. Intuitively, we consider these beliefs as knowledge regardless of cognitive differences.**, **If various cognitive designs can lead to true beliefs worthy of being called knowledge, there may be a tension with requiring uniformity in what cognitive faculties must properly function.**
