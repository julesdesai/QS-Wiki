## Content

**Someone validates a thermometer's accuracy by regularly checking it against temperatures they guestimate, building belief in its regular truth.**, **If the thermometer's readings were inconsistently false, the person might not detect fallibility due to reliance on assumption of partial truth absorbed through bootstrapping.**, **Epistemic intuition upholds that trust measurement devices may seat within knowledge regime contrary to sensitivity's rebuttal regarding hypothetical falsity.**
