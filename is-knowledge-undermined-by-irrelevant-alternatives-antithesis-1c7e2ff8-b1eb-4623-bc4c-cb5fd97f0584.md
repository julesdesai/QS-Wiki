## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone believes that a distant object is a barn based on visual perception, and it is indeed a barn. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows it is a barn.**, **Suppose there are many fake barns in the area that look identical from a distance. Intuitively, it seems that the presence of fake barns undermines the person's knowledge claim, even though the belief is true and would not be held if the proposition were false.**
