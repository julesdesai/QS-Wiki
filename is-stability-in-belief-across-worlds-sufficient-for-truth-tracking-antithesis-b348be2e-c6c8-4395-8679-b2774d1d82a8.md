## Content

**Suppose a doctor diagnoses a disease correctly based on the faulty test that coincidentally aligns with the actual presence of the disease. Intuitively, the diagnosis does not track the truth despite the correct outcome across worlds where similar tests yield the same results.**, **Reliability and an accurate, consistent method are necessary for truth-tracking, which mere stability does not guarantee when coincidental matching occurs.**
