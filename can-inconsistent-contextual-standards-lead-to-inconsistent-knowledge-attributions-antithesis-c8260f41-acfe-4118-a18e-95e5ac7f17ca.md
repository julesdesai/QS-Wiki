## Content

**Consider a scenario where two individuals assess the same claim from different contexts and reach different conclusions about the justification standards that apply. It is counterintuitive that both individuals could simultaneously have knowledge under this account**, **If differing contextual standards can lead to differing knowledge attributions in a single case, then the concept of knowledge becomes potentially inconsistent and dependent on arbitrary contextual features**
