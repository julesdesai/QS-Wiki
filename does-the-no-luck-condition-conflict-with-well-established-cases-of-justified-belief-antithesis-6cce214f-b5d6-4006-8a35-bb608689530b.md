## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has overwhelmingly strong evidence for a belief, the belief is true, but there is some irrelevant fact that makes it appear lucky. Intuitively, this should still count as knowledge.**, **A no-luck condition suggests that any element of luck undermines true belief being knowledge, yet principles of epistemic justification allow for some degree of luck.**, **It is implausible to reject cases of well-supported belief as knowledge simply because of incidental luck or unrelated coincidences.**
