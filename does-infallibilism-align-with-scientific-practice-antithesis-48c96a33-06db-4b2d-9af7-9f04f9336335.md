**Consider that scientific knowledge is typically based on theories and experiments that are open to revision and improvement. Intuitively, scientists are said to know certain facts even though future discoveries might challenge or refine these facts.**, **It is implausible that scientific knowledge, which is incrementally improved and potentially fallible, can meet the infallibilism standard, suggesting a divergence from actual scientific practice.**
