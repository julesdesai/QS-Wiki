## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief is necessary for a rational agent in a particular context, that belief could still constitute knowledge even without a direct causal link to a proposition being true. This principle together with common examples of necessary beliefs in scientific paradigms entails that necessary beliefs might be categorized as knowledge despite limitations posed by the causal theory.**
