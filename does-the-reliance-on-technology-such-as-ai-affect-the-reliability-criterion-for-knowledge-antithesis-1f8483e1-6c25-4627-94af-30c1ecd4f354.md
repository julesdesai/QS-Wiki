## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person relies on an AI system to form a belief, but the AI's processes are not fully understood by the user. Intuitively, it is difficult to discern whether the person possesses knowledge if the process's reliability is opaque.**, **There is a plausible principle that transparency in the reliability of processes, particularly for complex technologies, is necessary to ensure genuine knowledge is attributed.**
