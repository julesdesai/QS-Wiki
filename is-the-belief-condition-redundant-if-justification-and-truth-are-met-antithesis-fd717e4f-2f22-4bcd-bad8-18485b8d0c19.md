## Content

**Picture a case where an AI system processes data and outputs a true proposition with high defeasible justification without forming actual beliefs. Intuitively, the output seems like it meets conditions similar to knowledge even though the AI does not possess beliefs.**, **This raises the question of whether belief is a necessary component of knowledge if other conditions such as truth and justification are satisfied, suggesting belief may be unnecessary.**
