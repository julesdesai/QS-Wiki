## Content

**Consider a scenario where a student must justify their grade. In such a scenario, raising or lowering justification standards based on whether a professor is lenient or strict seems implausible for maintaining objectivity in grading.**, **Suppose we say the student knows they deserve an 'A' due to satisfying the justification in one context, but not another. This seems inconsistent with a stable conception of what it means to 'know' something.**
