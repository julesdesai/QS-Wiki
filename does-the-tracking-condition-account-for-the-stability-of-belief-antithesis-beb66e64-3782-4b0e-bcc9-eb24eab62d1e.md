## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes it is raining because they see wet streets, but this observation coincides with deliberate street wetting operations whenever it is not raining. Intuitively, if the streets are wet, they will believe it is raining whether or not it is actually true, raising questions about whether such beliefs satisfy Nozick's tracking condition consistently.**
