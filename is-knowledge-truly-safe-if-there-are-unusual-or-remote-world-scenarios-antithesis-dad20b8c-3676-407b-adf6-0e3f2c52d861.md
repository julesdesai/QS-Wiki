## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be robust across a range of normal situations. This principle together with unusual but possible scenarios, like a global shift in natural laws, entails doubts about the sufficiency of the 'nearby possible worlds' criterion for safety.**, **Consider a scenario where natural laws change overnight but temporarily, affecting truth conditions. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that someone's belief could be true here but not count as knowledge due to this anomaly.**
