## Content

**Consider a scenario where a doctor has accurate medical knowledge of a treatment but does not directly benefit from the outcome. Intuitively, whether the doctor has personal stakes does not impact their possession of knowledge about the treatment.**, **There is a plausible principle that the presence or absence of personal stakes does not inherently affect whether one possesses knowledge.**
