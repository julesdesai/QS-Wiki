## Content

**In a scenario where Tim believes, rightly, that his teacher owns a Ford because he's seen her drive it, unaware she's borrowing it and owns a different Ford he hasn't seen, intuitively we would say Tim does not truly know his teacher owns a Ford.**, **Gettier problems illustrate situations where a personâ€™s belief and truth align due to unrelated factors, not through reliable justification, yet the No-Defeaters View might mistakenly affirm knowledge.**, **True propositions that function as defeaters often appear irrelevant in Gettier cases, challenging the sufficiency of having no defeaters as a criterion for knowledge.**
