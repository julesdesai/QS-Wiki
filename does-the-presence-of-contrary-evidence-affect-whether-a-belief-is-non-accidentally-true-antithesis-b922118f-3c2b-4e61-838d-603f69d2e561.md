## Content

**Suppose a scientist believes a hypothesis is true based on established data but disregards new, conflicting evidence due to cognitive bias. The original belief is true and potentially non-accidentally so, given existing data, but the dismissal of new evidence may undermine its status as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires consideration and integration of all available evidence. This principle suggests that the sufficiency of non-accidental true belief as knowledge requires responsiveness to contrary evidence.**
