## Content

**A belief's coherence within a system does not guarantee its alignment with reality**, **Consider a case where an individual's beliefs, though coherent, are formed in isolation from any relevant empirical evidence**, **In such a case, intuitively, we would judge that the individual does not know the proposition due to the absence of an empirical grounding**
