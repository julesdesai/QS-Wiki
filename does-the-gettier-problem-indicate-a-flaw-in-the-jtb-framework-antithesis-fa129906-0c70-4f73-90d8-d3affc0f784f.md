## Content

**Consider a classic Gettier case where an individual holds a belief that is both true and justified, yet the truth of the belief is the result of luck rather than the justification. In such a case, intuitively we would judge that the individual does not have knowledge, indicating a flaw in the justified true belief framework.**
