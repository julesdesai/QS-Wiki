## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person holds a justified true belief because of faulty assumptions that lead to a correct conclusion. Intuitively, such scenarios show that justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a situation where a well-justified belief accidentally turns out to be true. Intuitively, accidental truth does not constitute knowledge.**
