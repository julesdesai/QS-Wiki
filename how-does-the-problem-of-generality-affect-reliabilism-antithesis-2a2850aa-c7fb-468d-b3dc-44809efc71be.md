## Content

**Suppose a person, Sam, arrives at a belief using a visual process that can be described at various levels of generality, such as "perception" or "afternoon vision in sunny conditions."**, **Different descriptions of the process can each have different reliability scores.**, **Reliabilism does not specify which level of description to use, thus failing to provide a clear criterion for the reliability condition required for knowledge.**
