## Content

**Envision a person believes there are dogs barking outside, justified by hearing barks and knowing their neighbors own dogs. However, all neighborhood dogs are absent, and the sound is the radio playing a dog bark track. An actual, unnoticed stray dog outside affirms the belief as true.**, **Intuitively, the lack of an initial true justification means that the person does not have knowledge, challenging the overall sufficiency of justified true belief.**
