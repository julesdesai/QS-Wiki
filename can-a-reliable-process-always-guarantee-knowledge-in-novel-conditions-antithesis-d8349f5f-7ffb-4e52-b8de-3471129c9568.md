**Suppose a person uses a compass in an area with unusual magnetic activity, causing the compass to malfunction and give a correct direction accidentally.**, **While the belief is true and seemingly results from a reliable process, the unusual conditions imply the process isn't reliable in this context. Knowledge might depend on the consistent reliability across varying contexts.**
