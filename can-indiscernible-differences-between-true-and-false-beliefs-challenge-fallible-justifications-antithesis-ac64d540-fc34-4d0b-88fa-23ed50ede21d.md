## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief with justification that makes it indiscernible from a false belief with similar justification. Intuition might claim that without discernible differences, the person lacks true knowledge.**, **A principle suggests knowledge must include discernibility between true and false belief states, contrary to what fallible justifications may support.**
