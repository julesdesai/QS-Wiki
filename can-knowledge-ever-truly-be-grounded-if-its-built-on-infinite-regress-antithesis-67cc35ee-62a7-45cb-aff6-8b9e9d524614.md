## Content

**It is implausible that a series of reasons that is infinite and non-repeating can be adequately justified or comprehensible by a human being.**, **Suppose we have a case where someone purports to justify their belief through an infinite series of reasons. Intuitively, we would question whether such a justification is accessible or manageable for verifying the belief.**, **A belief that requires an infinite series of reasons for its justification may never be fully articulated or completed due to the constraints of time and cognition.**
