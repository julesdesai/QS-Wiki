## Content

**Consider a scenario where a clairvoyant has an accurate belief about a future event based on an unreliable process of clairvoyance. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge the person does not have knowledge even if the cognitive process is accidentally reliable.**, **Suppose we have a case in which the process by which a person comes to form their belief is reliable in general, but in a particular instance, the belief happens to be true by sheer luck. Intuitively, we have to say that the person does not know the proposition because their belief is not based on the reliable operation of the cognitive process.**
