## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person relies on an unreliable memory process that occasionally provides correct information. The belief formed is true due to luck. Intuitively, we would say the person does not know, as the origin of the belief is not reliable.**, **There is a plausible principle that relying on unreliable processes, even when occasionally correct, undermines claims to knowledge as the correctness appears coincidental rather than evidential.**
