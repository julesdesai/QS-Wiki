## Content

**Consider a scenario in which determining the justification for a belief about quantum mechanics requires more rigorous standards than for everyday beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that the standards for justification can vary with context.**, **There is a plausible principle that different domains of knowledge require different standards of justification. This principle together with varying context suggests justification is not fixed.**, **The assumption that justification operates under a fixed standard irrespective of context is implausible.**
