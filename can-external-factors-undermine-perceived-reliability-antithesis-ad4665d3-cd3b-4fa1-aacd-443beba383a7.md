## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person relies on a typically reliable source, but unknown external manipulation affects the reliability of that source without affecting the truth of the specific belief formed. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say the person knows the proposition, as they are unaware of the external influences.**, **Awareness of and protection against external factors influencing reliability is essential to knowledge because unrecognized manipulation disrupts the link between reliability and truth.**
