## Content

**Suppose an infinite coherent chain can justify beliefs fallibly, admitting that justified beliefs might still be wrong.**, **Fallibilism allows for the possibility of error within justification, potentially challenging the infallibility presumed by an infinite chain.**, **If infinitist coherentism does not accommodate fallibility, it might fail to align with ordinary epistemic practices where knowledge persists despite potential error.**
