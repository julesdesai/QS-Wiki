## Content

**Imagine person P with a reliable belief forming mechanism believes the stock market will rise based on trend data. If there exists contrary insider information, unknown to P but true, this belief's reliability is undermined by these defeaters.**, **A plausible principle is that the presence of undermining defeaters, even with reliability, challenges the sufficiency condition for knowledge. Defeaters introduce considerations that might not affect process reliability yet impact knowledge.**
