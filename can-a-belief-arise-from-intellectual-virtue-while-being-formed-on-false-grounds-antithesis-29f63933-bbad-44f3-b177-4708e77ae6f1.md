## Content

**Consider a case where someone forms a belief using an unreliable horoscope which happens, coincidentally, to be true. Intuitively, we would judge that this is not knowledge.**, **The principle that a belief must arise from intellectual virtue or skill suggests that reliable cognitive faculties are being used. If the belief is formed on false grounds but is true by coincidence, the use of intellectual faculties is questionable.**
