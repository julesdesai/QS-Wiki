## Content

**Suppose we have a case where two reliable processes yield contradictory propositions that a person believes to be true simultaneously. Intuitively, one might be inclined to deny that the resultant belief constitutes knowledge due to the contradiction.**, **It is implausible to claim that two conflicting reliable processes can independently produce knowledge if they result in completely opposing beliefs.**
