## Content

**Imagine a person holds a proposition true without actively considering it, such as subconsciously knowing the route to work without explicitly entertaining the belief about the steps. The belief aids their navigation when explicitly required, suggesting their knowledge isn't constantly in conscious thought.**, **There is a plausible principle that conscious awareness of one's belief is required for it to qualify as knowledge. This principle suggests that latent or subconscious correct beliefs without active acceptance may not constitute knowledge.**
