## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at a true belief through random guessing rather than a causal link to the fact. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not have knowledge despite the truth of the belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just a true belief, justification, and a causal connection; it also requires an appropriate method of belief formation. This principle suggests that merely having a true belief that is causally connected to the fact is not sufficient for knowledge.**
