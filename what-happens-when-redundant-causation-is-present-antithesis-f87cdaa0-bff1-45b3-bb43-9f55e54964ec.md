**There is a plausible principle that if multiple independent causal chains could establish a belief, then redundancy might challenge the sufficiency of the causal chain for knowledge. This principle together with the redundancy of causal connections entails potential insufficiency for knowledge if not all chains are reliable or known by the subject.**
