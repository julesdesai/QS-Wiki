## Content

**Consider a case where a person justifies their belief in a basic perceptual claim, like "I see a tree," with an infinite series of reasons. Intuitively, we must ask whether this infinite chain adds any significant value to justify the belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that basic beliefs require finite justification to serve as a foundation for more complex knowledge. Infinite justifications seem to undermine this foundational role.**
