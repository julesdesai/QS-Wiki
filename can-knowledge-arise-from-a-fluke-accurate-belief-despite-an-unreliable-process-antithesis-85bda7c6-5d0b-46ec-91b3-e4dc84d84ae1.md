## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition due to a lucky guess, but the cognitive process used is generally unreliable. Intuitively, we either have to say that they do not know the proposition or that knowledge can result from chance. If we say they know the proposition, then knowledge can be based on chance, which seems incorrect.**
