## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person glances at a broken clock and forms the belief that it is noon because they think the clock is functioning and displaying the correct time. Coincidentally, it actually is noon. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite their belief being true.**, **In this case, although the belief is true and the person believes it, the causal chain connecting the belief to the truth involves an accidental element – the broken clock – which undermines the knowledge claim.**
