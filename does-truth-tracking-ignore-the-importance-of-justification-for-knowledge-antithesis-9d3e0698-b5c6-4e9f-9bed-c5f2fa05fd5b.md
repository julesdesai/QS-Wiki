## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a belief that tracks truth accurately but lacks any form of justification for the belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition due to truth-tracking or doesn't know due to lack of justification. If we say they know, we undermine the role of justification. If we say they don't know, it indicates that truth-tracking alone is insufficient for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that considers justification a necessary element of knowledge to avoid arbitrary true beliefs being labeled as knowledge.**
