## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person believes a true proposition derived from a reliable process. However, the person is entirely unaware of the nature or existence of this process. Intuitively, it seems questionable whether the person possesses knowledge without awareness of how their belief is reliably formed.**, **There is a plausible principle stating that knowledge entails an awareness or consciousness of the methods or processes that underlie one's belief. This principle suggests that absence of awareness may preclude knowledge.**
