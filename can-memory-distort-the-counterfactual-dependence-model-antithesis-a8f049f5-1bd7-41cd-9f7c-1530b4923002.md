## Content

**Consider a situation in which a belief formed from true memory is now remembered inaccurately, but the original belief remains true. Intuitively, we may doubt whether this counts as knowledge.**, **A belief with distorted memory that remains true challenges the idea that counterfactual dependence ensures knowledge.**, **If memory's accuracy impacts counterfactual links, knowledge claims based solely on dependence are threatened.**
