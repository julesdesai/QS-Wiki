# Could there be scenarios where sensitivity leads to problematic closure of knowledge?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** ea588fbb-aefe-4933-a826-cf2ded97fe6c
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Sensitivity](knowledge-as-sensitivity-synthesis-dd7b81b4-92e7-4930-8759-83da210d89be.md)

## Content

**A person knows a proposition and comes to know another logically related proposition through deduction. If sensitivity fails for the second belief, sensitivity suggests a failure in knowledge closure, which is counterintuitive.**, **A plausible principle asserts that knowledge should be closed under known entailments, challenging sensitivity.**
