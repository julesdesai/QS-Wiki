## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a belief system is consistent and coheres with itself but is founded on a fundamentally flawed premise, such as a misinterpretation of a key concept. Such foundational flaws intuitively undermine claims to knowledge within this system.**, **A coherent set of beliefs can still be entirely based on some critical initial misunderstanding or error that propagates through the system.**, **The sufficiency claim of coherentism seems threatened when coherence is achieved at the expense of core reliability.**
