## Content

**Imagine a world where empirical knowledge develops, demanding different standards of justification over time due to increased information complexity. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that static standards appear inadequate.**, **There is a plausible principle that an adaptable justification standard is necessary to accommodate the evolution of human understanding and knowledge. This principle together with a universally fixed standard suggests potential inadequacies and errors in knowledge claims over time.**
