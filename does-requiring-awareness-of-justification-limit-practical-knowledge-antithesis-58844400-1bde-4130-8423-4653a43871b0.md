## Content

**In many practical situations, people act on knowledge even if they cannot explicitly identify or articulate the justification behind it at the moment. Intuitively, these could still be cases of knowledge.**, **The requirement of being aware of one's justification might unnecessarily limit the concept of knowledge in everyday practical contexts where people effectively use knowledge without verbalizing or recognizing justification.**
