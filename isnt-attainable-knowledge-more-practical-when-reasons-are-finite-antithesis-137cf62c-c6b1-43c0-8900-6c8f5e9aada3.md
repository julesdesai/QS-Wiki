## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a belief that the weather is sunny, justified by an infinite series of reasons. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person might never fully access all reasons, casting doubt on their claim to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be attainable and verifiable within a finite human capacity. This principle together with the requirement of infinite justification entails that such knowledge is impractical.**
