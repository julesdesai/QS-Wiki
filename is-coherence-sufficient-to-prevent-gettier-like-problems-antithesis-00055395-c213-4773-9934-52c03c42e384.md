**Consider a Gettier case where a person has a justified true belief that accidentally coheres with other beliefs, like believing the time by a stopped clock. Intuitively, this is not knowledge despite coherence.**, **Coherence fails to avoid Gettier cases, showing coherence and true belief might not suffice for knowledge.**
