## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone randomly guesses a number correctly in a lottery, forming a true belief about the outcome. Intuitively, we would say this is not knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that a belief formed through a reliable process is knowledge, yet this may occasionally result in a belief being true merely by accident.**
