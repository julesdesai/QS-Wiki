## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual believes a true proposition because of a reliable belief-forming process, but in many nearby possible situations, the same process would lead to a false belief. In this scenario, intuitively we would judge that the individual does not have knowledge.**, **Suppose the belief is true and safe from error in the actual situation, but small changes in the situation could lead to false beliefs. It is implausible to call this knowledge.**
