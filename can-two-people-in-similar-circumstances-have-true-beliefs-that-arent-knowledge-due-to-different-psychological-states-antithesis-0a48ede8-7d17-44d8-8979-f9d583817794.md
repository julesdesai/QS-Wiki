## Content

**Consider cases where two individuals, under identical external circumstances, believe a true proposition. Intuitively, we could judge one possesses knowledge if their belief aligns with their evidence, while the other does not due to cognitive biases affecting their belief.**, **It is implausible that mere externalist factors, such as a belief not easily being false, can suffice for knowledge without considering the epistemic internalist condition of proper cognitive states.**
