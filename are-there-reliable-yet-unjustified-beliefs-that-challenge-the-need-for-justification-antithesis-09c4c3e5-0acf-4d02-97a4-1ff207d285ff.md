## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a justified belief is required for knowledge. This principle together with the existence of reliable cognitive processes that produce beliefs without evidence entails that reliability alone does not guarantee justification.**, **Imagine a situation in which a person has a belief produced by a reliable process but lacks any justification or evidence for this belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know, as justification seems to be missing.**
