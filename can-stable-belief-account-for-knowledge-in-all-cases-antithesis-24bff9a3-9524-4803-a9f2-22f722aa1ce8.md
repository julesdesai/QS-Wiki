## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person temporarily loses belief in a true proposition but regains belief later. Intuitively, we would judge that they lack knowledge during the lapse in belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires continuous belief. If a person temporarily disbelieves a true proposition, they lack knowledge of it during that period.**
