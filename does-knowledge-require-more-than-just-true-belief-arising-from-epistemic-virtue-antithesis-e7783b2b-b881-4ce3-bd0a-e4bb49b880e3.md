## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not just true belief and epistemic virtue, but also the exclusion of Gettier-type luck. A Gettier-type luck refers to cases where a person has a justified true belief, but still fails to have knowledge due to seemingly irrelevant coincidences. This principle together with the necessity for epistemic virtue entails that mere true belief from virtue is not sufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person's belief is true and results from epistemic virtue, but there is an element of luck similar to the situations found in Gettier cases. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a belief constituting knowledge could be accompanied by luck in a similar way to Gettier cases, as our intuitions reject luck as a factor in genuine knowledge.**
