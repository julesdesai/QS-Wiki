## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a very rare astronomical event will occur, based only on a hunch and scattered reports that do not form a coherent web of beliefs. The event does occur as the person predicted. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge about the event.**, **In this scenario, although the personâ€™s belief is true and they believe it, the belief neither coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs nor is it supported by foundational beliefs.**
