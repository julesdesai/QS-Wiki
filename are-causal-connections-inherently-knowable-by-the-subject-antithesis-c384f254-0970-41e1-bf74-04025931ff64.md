## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person accurately picks a card from a deck because of a rigged deck designed by someone else. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know they will pick that card, as they are unaware of the causal rigging involved.**, **A causal connection unknown to the person is insufficient for ensuring that the person has knowledge.**
