## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person must make a high-stakes decision based on their belief in a proposition; if stakes are increased, their context-sensitive justification may shift. Intuitively, we would judge that pragmatic factors should not alter the truth of their knowledge claim, suggesting that context-sensitivity linked to stakes undermines stable justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not vary across different contexts when factual content is constant.**
