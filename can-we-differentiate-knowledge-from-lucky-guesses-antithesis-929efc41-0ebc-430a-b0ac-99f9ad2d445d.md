## Content

**Consider a case where someone believes a proposition because of a lucky guess, and it turns out to be true with no causal connection. Intuitively, this should not count as knowledge.**, **A proposition may be true, a belief held, yet no direct causal chain connects them beyond a lucky guess, challenging the sufficiency of causal links for knowledge.**
