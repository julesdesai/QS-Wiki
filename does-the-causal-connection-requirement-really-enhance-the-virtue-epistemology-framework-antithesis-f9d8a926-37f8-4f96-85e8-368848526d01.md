## Content

**It is implausible that all intellectual virtues inherently incorporate causal connections to the truth. This casts doubt on their role in a sufficient account of knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person develops a true belief through reliable instincts rather than through direct causal connections. Intuitively, this could still be considered knowledge, challenging the causal roots requirement.**
