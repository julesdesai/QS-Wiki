## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes, without being able to access or articulate infinitely justifying reasons. Intuitively, we might doubt they have knowledge despite the presumed coherence.**, **The coherence of belief with an infinite chain is not empirically verifiable, raising concerns about how we can ascertain that someone truly 'knows'.**, **Practical verification requires that the conditions for knowledge should be accessible and testable, challenging the feasibility of evaluating infinitist conditions.**
