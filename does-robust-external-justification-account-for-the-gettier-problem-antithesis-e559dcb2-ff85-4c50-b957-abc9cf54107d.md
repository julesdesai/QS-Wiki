## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a justified true belief that meets external justification criteria but is based on a false premise. Intuitively, we would say this is not a case of knowledge.**, **Gettier problems demonstrate cases where justified true belief fails to constitute knowledge and challenge the sufficiency of defeasibility.**
