## Content

**Suppose we have a case where Bob believes a true proposition due to a justified false belief that coincidentally falters in an expected way to make his belief true and safe. Intuitively, we either have to say that Bob knows the true proposition or doesn't. If we say he knows, then this clashes with our intuition about knowledge. If we say he doesn't, then safety fails to capture all aspects of knowledge.**
