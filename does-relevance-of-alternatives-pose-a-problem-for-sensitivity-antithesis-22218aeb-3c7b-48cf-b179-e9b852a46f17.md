## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a person knows a proposition if they can differentiate it from relevant alternatives. This principle together with sensitivity may make differentiating between relevant alternatives unnecessary for knowledge.**, **In a scenario where sensitivity is satisfied but relevant alternatives are not ruled out, intuitively the condition of knowledge appears unmet.**
