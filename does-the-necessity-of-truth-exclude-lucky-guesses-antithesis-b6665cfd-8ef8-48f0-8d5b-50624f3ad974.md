## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person guesses the outcome of a coin toss and believes it will land on heads, and it does land on heads. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows it will land on heads or merely guessed correctly. If we say they know, it seems overly permissive, as knowledge should not be based purely on chance.**
