## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a group of individuals, the Virtualists, live in a completely virtual environment, developing a coherent belief system based entirely on simulated data. Intuitively, we either have to say that the Virtualists' beliefs constitute knowledge or that they do not because of lack of real-world input. If we say the Virtualists do not possess knowledge, then it suggests empirical input is necessary for genuine knowledge. If we say they do possess knowledge, then it undermines the relevance of empirical input in knowledge.**
