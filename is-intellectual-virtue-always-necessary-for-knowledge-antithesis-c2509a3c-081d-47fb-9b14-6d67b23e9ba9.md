## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition by sheer luck rather than through intellectual virtue. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might still want to say the person knows the proposition despite the absence of intellectual virtue.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge can be gained through reliable processes even if these do not stem from intellectual virtue. This principle suggests that intellectual virtue may not always be necessary for knowledge.**
