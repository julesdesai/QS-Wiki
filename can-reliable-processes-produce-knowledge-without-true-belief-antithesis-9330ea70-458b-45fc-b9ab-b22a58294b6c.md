## Content

**Consider a scenario where a cognitive process reliably produces beliefs that align with most truths, but occasionally generates a belief that is false though believed to be true. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the individual does not possess knowledge of the false belief despite the process's general reliability.**, **Even if a belief were true and produced by such a reliable process, the presence of isolated false beliefs challenges the sufficiency of reliability for knowledge.**
