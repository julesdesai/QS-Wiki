## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a basic belief that is true only due to coincidence or luck, and not because of any direct justification. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is implausible for knowledge to depend on factors as arbitrary or uncontrollable as luck.**
