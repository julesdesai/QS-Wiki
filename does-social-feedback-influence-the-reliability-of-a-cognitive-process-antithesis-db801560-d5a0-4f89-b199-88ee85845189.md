## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief is shaped by a reliable cognitive process but is heavily influenced by social feedback that is misleading. Intuitively, we would judge that the belief is not wholly reliable due to external distortion and thus not knowledge.**, **It is implausible that social factors could completely undermine the reliability of a process without affecting the knowledge claim.**
