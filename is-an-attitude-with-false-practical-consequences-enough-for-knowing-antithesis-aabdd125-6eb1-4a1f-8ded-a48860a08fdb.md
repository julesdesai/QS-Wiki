## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual believes a medical treatment is effective, this belief is true, but the efficacy mentioned is based on placebo rather than actual pharmacological action. The belief has practical consequences in terms of improved health.**, **Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the treatment is effective based on practical consequences, or that the placebo effect complicates the notion of practical usefulness. If we say knowledge exists due to practical consequences, it undermines the reliability needed for knowledge.**
