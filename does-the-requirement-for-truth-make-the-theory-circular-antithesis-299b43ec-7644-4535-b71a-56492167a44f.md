## Content

**The concept of a reliable cognitive process assumes the notion of truth in determining reliability, which seems to presuppose what it aims to define, creating a potential circularity in the explanation of knowledge.**, **If a reliable process is judged reliable because it frequently leads to true beliefs, the use of 'truth' to define reliability appears circular and diminishes the explanatory power of the theory.**
