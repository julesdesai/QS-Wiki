## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified belief in a proposition that is true only by coincidence, such as a lucky guess on an exam. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite meeting the conditions of justified true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just justified true belief; it requires a connection between the justification and the truth that is not coincidental.**
