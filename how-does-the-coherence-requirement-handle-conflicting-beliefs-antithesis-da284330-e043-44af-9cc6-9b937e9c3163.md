## Content

**Suppose a person holds a network of beliefs, some of which are justified, and some are not, such that the true belief in question coheres with both. Intuitively, having unjustified beliefs in the mix should undermine the status of the network as providing knowledge.**, **A coherentist theory assumes that coherence among beliefs provides justification, but if coherence involves false beliefs too, the justification seems compromised.**
