## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has strong justificatory evidence for a proposition based on faulty or incomplete information. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge or merely strong belief. If we say knowledge about this case, then it clashes with the necessity of truth. If we say merely strong belief about this case, then this highlights justification does not guarantee alignment with truth.**, **A principle exists that links justification closely to truth for knowledge consideration. This principle together with the variability and fallibility in justificatory practices suggests justification independent of truth does not suffice for knowledge.**, **Justification can be complete and robust while still failing to coincide with the truth required for knowledge.**
