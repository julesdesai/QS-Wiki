## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person initially believes a true proposition, encounters misleading but credible evidence that leads them to temporarily abandon the belief, but eventually returns to the correct belief. Intuitively, it seems this person had knowledge throughout, despite a temporary change in belief.**, **It is plausible that a person can know a proposition even if their belief does not constantly track the truth across all possible situations, particularly in the presence of misleading evidence.**
