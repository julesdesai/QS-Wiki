## Content

**It is implausible that everyday speakers can clearly identify and agree on when context changes justify altering the standards for knowledge justification.**, **Consider a scenario where speakers in a conversation are unsure if they have transitioned from a low-standard to a high-standard context. Intuitively, such uncertainty makes it difficult to accurately ascribe knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that criteria for knowledge should be clear and effectively communicable so that agreement on knowledge claims can be reached. This principle together with unclear contextual boundaries suggests difficulty in achieving clear communication.**
