## Content

**Consider a situation where a person forms a belief through a generally reliable cognitive process, but the specific belief formed is true by sheer luck. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge because the truth of the belief seems accidental.**, **A reliable cognitive process that leads to truth by chance undermines the reliability criteria for knowledge.**
