## Content

**Consider a scenario where what counts as appropriate justification changes not only with contexts but with individuals' subjective interpretations of those contexts. Intuitively, this suggests a troubling vagueness about when justification truly suffices.**, **It is implausible that such vagueness should dictate the conditions under which individuals are said to know propositions, as it would lead to inconsistent and arbitrary attributions of knowledge.**
