## Content

**Suppose Ellen believes a true proposition based on substantial evidence, but there exists significant opposing evidence she is unaware of. Intuitively, we might doubt whether Ellen's belief constitutes knowledge.**, **The presence of counter-evidence not considered may erode the sufficiency of non-fallacious justification even if unbeknownst to the believer.**
