**Consider a case where someone forms a true belief based significantly on practical concerns or stakes, rather than purely epistemic reasons. Intuitively, we might still regard this as knowledge under certain practical contexts.**, **A principle that considers only strict epistemic conditions for knowledge may overlook the influence of pragmatic considerations in real-world attributions of knowledge.**, **The role of factors like urgency, importance, or external pressures might reveal limitations in strictly epistemic conditions for knowledge.**
