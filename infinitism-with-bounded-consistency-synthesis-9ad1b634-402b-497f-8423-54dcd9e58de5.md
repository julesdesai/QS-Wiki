**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification involves an infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons with bounded consistency constraints to avoid divergence**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and there exists an infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons with bounded consistency constraints justifying the belief**
