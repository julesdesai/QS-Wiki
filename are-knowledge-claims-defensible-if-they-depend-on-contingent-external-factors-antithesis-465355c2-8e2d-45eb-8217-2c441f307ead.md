## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person knows a proposition about a local event based solely on a chance overhearing of a strangerâ€™s reliable testimony. Intuitively, if the overhearing had not occurred, they would not know the event happened.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not rely on highly contingent, external factors subject to change.**, **The dependency on incidental events conflicts with stable and reliable justification expected in a robust defense of knowledge.**
