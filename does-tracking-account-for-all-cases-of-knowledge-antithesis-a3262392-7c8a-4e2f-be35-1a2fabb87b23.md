## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that the stock market will rise, it is true, and they would not believe it if it were false due to weather forecasts. Intuitively, we would judge that such belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **The person’s belief about the stock market is influenced by an unrelated factor—weather forecasts—which should not determine knowledge of the market’s rise.**
