## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if two people have the same evidence and beliefs about a proposition, they should both either know or not know that proposition.**, **Consider a scenario where two people have the same belief based on identical evidence in different contexts. In one context, the standard of justification is met, and in the other, it is not. Intuitively, we would judge that one knows and the other does not.**, **It is logically inconsistent to claim that identical evidence can result in both knowledge and lack of knowledge for the same proposition without contradiction.**
