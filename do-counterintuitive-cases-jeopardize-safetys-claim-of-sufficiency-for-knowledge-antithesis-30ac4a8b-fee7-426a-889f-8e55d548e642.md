## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person has a true and safe belief due to being in a distorted environment where nearly any belief would be safe, intuitively, this belief lacks knowledge because of how it was formed.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot merely rely on environmental conditions but also needs consideration of the cognitive process, which suggests sufficiency may be inadequate.**
