## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief based on a reliable cognitive process, but does so with poor reasoning or accidental evidence. We may judge that this does not result in knowledge.**, **Merely having a belief formed from a reliable process is insufficient for knowledge without proper justification in decision-making.**, **For an individual to be credited with knowledge, the acceptance of belief should align with rational and considered judgment, not merely process-driven beliefs.**
