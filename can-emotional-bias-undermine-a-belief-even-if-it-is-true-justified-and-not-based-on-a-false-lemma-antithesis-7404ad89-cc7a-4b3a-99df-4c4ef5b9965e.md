## Content

**Consider an investor who overestimates a company's success due to emotional attachment, yet the company becomes unexpectedly successful. The belief is true, justified by evidence, and not based on a false lemma. However, intuitively we would judge the emotional bias challenges the claim of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge necessitates objectivity in forming beliefs. Biases indicate a failure in achieving unbiased justification, questioning the claim of knowledge.**
