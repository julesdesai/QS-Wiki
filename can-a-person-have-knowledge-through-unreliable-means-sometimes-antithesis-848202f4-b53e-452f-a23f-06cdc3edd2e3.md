## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief through an unreliable process like a faulty thermometer and the belief happens to be true. Intuitively, we either have to say this belief is not knowledge because the process is unreliable or accept some unreliable beliefs as knowledge, which conflicts with the reliabilist view.**
