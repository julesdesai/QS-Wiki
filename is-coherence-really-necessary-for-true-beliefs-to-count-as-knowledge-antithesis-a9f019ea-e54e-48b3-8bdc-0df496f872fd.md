**There are cases where a person has a true belief without any apparent system of interconnected beliefs to cohere with, like a gut feeling or intuition lacking supportive beliefs.**, **Intuitively, it seems possible for such a belief to count as knowledge if correct, despite lacking coherence with other beliefs.**
