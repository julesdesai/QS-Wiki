## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtues are generally only loosely correlated with producing true beliefs. This principle suggests that the presence of an intellectual virtue may not always lead to truth.**, **Suppose a situation where a person employs intellectual virtues to evaluate information critically but due to misinformation or error in data, their formed belief is false. The reliance on intellectual virtues may misleadingly suggest a closer tie to truth than what is consistently actual.**
