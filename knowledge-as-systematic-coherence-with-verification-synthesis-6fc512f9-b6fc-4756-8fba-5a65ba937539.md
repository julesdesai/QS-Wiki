**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is justified by coherence with theories that are regularly verified by interaction with external reality**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, the belief coheres within a system that is systematically verified by empirical evidence**
