## Content

**Consider a situation in which a person forms a true belief using a reliable process, but the situation is one where all involved conspire to deceive the person, who coincidentally arrives at truth. Intuitively, this seems to undermine the claim to knowledge.**, **Beliefs formed in a context structured by deceptive manipulations may be true and reliably formed but fail to be knowledge due to the contrived conditions.**
