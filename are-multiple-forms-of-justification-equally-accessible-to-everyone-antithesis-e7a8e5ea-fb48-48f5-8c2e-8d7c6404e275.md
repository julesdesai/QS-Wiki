## Content

**Consider a scenario where different forms of justification, such as empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and pragmatic consequences, are needed for knowledge. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that not everyone has equal access to all these forms of justification.**, **It is implausible that knowledge should require justifications that are not equally accessible across different individuals.**
