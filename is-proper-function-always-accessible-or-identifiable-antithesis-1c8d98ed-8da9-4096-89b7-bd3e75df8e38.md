## Content

**Suppose we encounter a scenario where cognitive scientists cannot determine if faculties are functioning correctly due to unknown variables. Intuitively, in such cases, knowledge must still be possible despite the inability to identify proper function.**, **It is implausible to claim that for knowledge, proper cognitive function must be identifiable when one considers the limits of human epistemic access.**
