## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone forms a true belief through a faulty or invalid logical inference. Intuitively, we would judge that the person doesn't know the proposition, due to the flawed inferential process, regardless of their belief being true and resistant to falsity.**, **There is a plausible principle that logical validity is a component of knowledge, suggesting true belief alone, even under safety conditions, is insufficient if the belief arises through invalid reasoning.**
