## Content

**Suppose we have a situation in which person A's justification for a belief is considered sufficient in one community but not in another due to differing contextual standards. Intuitively, we either have to say that person A knows or does not know the proposition. If we say person A knows in one context and not in another only based on community views, then such a stance seems to introduce unacceptable subjectivity into what counts as knowledge.**
