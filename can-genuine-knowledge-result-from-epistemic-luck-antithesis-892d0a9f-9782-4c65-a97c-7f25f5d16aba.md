## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief about a proposition that is true and arises from intellectual virtue but their belief is based on misleading evidence which luckily turns out to be true. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person, due to a mistaken calculation, forms a belief that accurately reflects the reality due to an unexpected turn of events. Intuitively, we would have to say that their belief is significantly lucky. If we say the person knows the proposition in this case, then knowledge can result from epistemic luck. If we say the person does not know the proposition, then belief arising from intellectual virtue is not sufficient for knowledge.**
