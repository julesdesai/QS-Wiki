## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a researcher has overwhelming evidence for a particular scientific theory but later discoveries prove the theory false. Intuitively, this suggests that the researcher had justified belief but not true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification can be fully met yet the belief can still be false, challenging the notion that truth must be a component of knowledge.**
