## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a student forms a correct belief through rote memorization. Intuitively, we either have to say that the student knows the information despite it not being the result of an intellectual virtue, or we must deny knowledge in typical educational contexts. If we say the student knows, then the necessity for intellectual virtue is undermined. If we deny the student knows, then intellectual environments where memorization is prevalent are not conducive to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge is only present in cases of intellectual virtue, given that many instances of what we consider knowledge arise from non-virtuous processes.**
