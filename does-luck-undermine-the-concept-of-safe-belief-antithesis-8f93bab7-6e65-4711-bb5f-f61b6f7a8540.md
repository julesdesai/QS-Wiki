## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a weather report predicting rain because it is usually reliable, but this time the prediction was only correct by luck due to an unpredicted weather anomaly. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows it will rain or that they do not know. If we say the person knows, this seems to make knowledge too dependent on luck. If we say the person does not know, it suggests that safe belief plus truth is insufficient for knowledge.**
