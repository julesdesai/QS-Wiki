## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person accurately believes a proposition due to sheer luck, such as guessing the number of marbles in a jar. By chance, their belief corresponds to the truth of the proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person does not have knowledge, despite the truth of their belief.**, **The causal theory requires an appropriate causal connection between belief and truth for knowledge to exist, but in this scenario, such a causal connection is absent, yet the belief is true.**, **If an appropriate causal connection is a necessary condition for knowledge, cases of true belief by luck should not count as knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of the causal theory.**
