## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be epistemically justified to the extent required for knowledge, it must be grounded in a way that tracks truth. This principle, together with the notion that coherence alone ensures epistemic justification, entails a tension since coherence does not inherently involve tracking truth.**
