## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a connection to the truth. This principle together with the scenario of false beliefs that appear justified by intellectual virtues entails that possessing virtues alone does not guarantee the possession of true beliefs.**, **Consider a case in which a person has a justified belief formed through intellectual virtues that turns out to be false due to circumstances beyond their control. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not actually have knowledge despite meeting the virtue criteria.**
