## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person predicts an election outcome correctly by guessing. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know the outcome or they had a lucky guess. If we say they know, then justification on foundational beliefs is unnecessary. If we say it is a lucky guess, then true belief without foundational justification is possible.**
