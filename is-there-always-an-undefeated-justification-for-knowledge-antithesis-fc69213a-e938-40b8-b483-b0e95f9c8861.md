## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justifications for knowledge can be perpetually at risk of being defeated by new evidence. This principle suggests that we may never truly have an undefeated justification for any belief.**, **Suppose we have a person with a justified true belief about a proposition, but, due to ever-present new evidence potential, their justification is never conclusively undefeated. Intuitively, this perpetual vulnerability questions their claim to knowledge.**
