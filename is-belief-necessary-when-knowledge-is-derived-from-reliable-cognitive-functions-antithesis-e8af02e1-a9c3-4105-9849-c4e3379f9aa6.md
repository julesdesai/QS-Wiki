## Content

**Consider a scenario where a personâ€™s cognitive system functions in such a way that they act on a true proposition with perfect accuracy and effectiveness, as if they know it, but they cannot form a conscious belief about it. Intuitively, this seems to suggest a form of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable cognitive function, rather than explicit belief, can be sufficient for knowledge. This offers a challenge to the necessity of belief for knowledge.**
