## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone, using their intellectual virtues such as careful reasoning and critical thinking, arrives at a false belief due to misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person is exercising intellectual virtues regardless of the belief's truth value.**, **It is implausible that a false belief could be an instance of knowledge, even if it results from intellectual virtue. This implausibility challenges whether intellectual virtue is a necessary condition for knowledge.**
