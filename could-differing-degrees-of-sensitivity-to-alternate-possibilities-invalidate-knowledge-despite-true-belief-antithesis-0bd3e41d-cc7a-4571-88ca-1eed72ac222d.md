## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone holds a true belief, but if the circumstances were only slightly different, they would hold a false belief. Intuitively, we sense that this lack of sensitivity to alternate possibilities undermines knowledge.**, **It is implausible that simply avoiding easily false scenarios suffices for knowledge if the person's belief might change with minimal alterations to conditions.**
