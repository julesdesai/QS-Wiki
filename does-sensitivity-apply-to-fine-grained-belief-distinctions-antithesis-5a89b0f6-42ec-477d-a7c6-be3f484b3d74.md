**Imagine a situation where a person, Larry, distinguishes between subtly different shades of color. Believing that a color exists in one shade leads to an unintended belief if a near-similar shade were present without recognition.**, **For an exact sufficiency condition, fine-grained differentiation in beliefs ought to be detectable. Sensitivity restrictions cannot sufficiently satisfy fine granularity in distinct belief states and propensities.**
