## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Jane, forms the belief that a bird is in a tree by looking out the window. Her vision is usually reliable, and there is indeed a bird, but it is obscured by leaves and cannot be seen. She actually sees a plastic bird that was placed there as a prank. Intuitively, we would judge that Jane does not know there is a bird in the tree.**, **A belief is considered a lucky guess when its truth is accidental or coincidental, despite being true and justified. If Jane's belief that a bird is in the tree is true due to coincidence or luck rather than her reliable visual process, then the belief is a lucky guess rather than knowledge.**
