## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone forms a true belief through reasoning from a false premise, such as inferring that a person owns a Ford based on seeing a friend drive a rented Ford. Intuitively, we would judge that despite having a true belief, the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must exclude cases of accidentally true belief derived from false information. This principle together with cases of Gettier-style scenarios suggests that true belief alone is not adequate for knowledge.**
