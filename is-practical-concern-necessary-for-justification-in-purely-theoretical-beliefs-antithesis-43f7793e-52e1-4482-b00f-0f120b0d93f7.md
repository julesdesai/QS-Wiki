## Content

**Consider a case where two scientists have the same evidence for a theoretical proposition, but different practical stakes in the outcome of the proposition's truth.**, **If justification depends on practical concerns, their level of justification might differ purely due to their stakes.**, **Intuitively, we either have to say that differences in justification are warranted, which devalues objectivity in theory, or unjustified, preserving theoretical knowledge as practically irrelevant.**
