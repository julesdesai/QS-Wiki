## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, justification involves an infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons**, **The simplicity of a chain is determined contextually, based on the epistemic environment**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, there is an infinite chain of reasons justifying the belief, and contextual simplicity is satisfied**
