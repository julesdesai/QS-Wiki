## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **Knowledge requires that there are no true propositions that, if believed, would defeat the justification for the original belief within the context of one's awareness**, **The absence of defeaters, relative only to the individual's epistemic situation, secures the justification status of belief**
