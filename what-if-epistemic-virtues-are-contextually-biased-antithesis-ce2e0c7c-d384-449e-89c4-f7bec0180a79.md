## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which epistemic virtues are defined in a way that is culturally or contextually biased, favoring specific forms of inquiry or understanding. Intuitively, we either have to say that knowledge is dependent on culturally specific virtues or not. If we say knowledge depends on culturally specific virtues, then knowledge claims are not universally valid. If we say knowledge is universally valid, then epistemic virtues cannot be the only basis for such knowledge.**
