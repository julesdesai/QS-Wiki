## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition through the exercise of epistemic virtues but simultaneously engages in morally objectionable conduct related to the belief, such as obtaining the information through deceit. Intuitively, we either have to say that knowledge can be undermined by moral failings or that it cannot. If we say knowledge can be undermined, then epistemic virtues alone may not be sufficient for knowledge. If we say knowledge cannot be undermined, then epistemic virtues seem isolated from other virtues in a way that may seem counterintuitive.**
