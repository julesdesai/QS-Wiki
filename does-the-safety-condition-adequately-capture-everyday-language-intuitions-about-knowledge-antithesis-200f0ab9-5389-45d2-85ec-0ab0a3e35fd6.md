## Content

**Suppose a person believes a simple fact about their immediate environment, such as the time, based on a glance at a clock that is occasionally broken. In nearby worlds, the clock shows incorrect times. Intuitively, we might say the person knows the time.**, **Knowledge requiring safety from error seems to conflict with ordinary language judgments, which allow knowledge in situations where safety is breached in nearby worlds.**, **If our linguistic practices suggest knowledge in cases lacking safety, then the safety condition might not align with our understanding of knowledge.**
