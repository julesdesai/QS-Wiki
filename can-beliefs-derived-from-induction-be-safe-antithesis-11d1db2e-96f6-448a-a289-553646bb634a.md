## Content

**Consider a scenario where Helen forms a belief about future events based on repeated past observations, such as sunrise. In a nearby possible world where the belief was formed similarly, events might unfold differently due to factors unknown at the time. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that while her belief is based on induction, it may not be safely true.**, **It is implausible that inductive knowledge can depend solely on safety in nearby possible worlds without any guarantee about the future resembling the past.**
