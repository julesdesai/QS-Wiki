## Content

**Consider a scenario where an artificial intelligence system uses a highly reliable algorithm to produce a true conclusion. Intuitively, we might not attribute knowledge to the AI due to the lack of personal cognitive involvement.**, **Imagine a scenario where a person uses a calculator, which processes figures reliably, to solve a problem. If the person has no understanding or belief about how the solution relates to the problem, we might hesitate to say that the person knows the answer even if the calculator's result is accurate.**
