## Content

**Suppose knowledge depends on a unique, infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons. Intuitively, this challenges the sharing of knowledge since others would need to navigate the same infinite chain.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a proposition to be known publicly, the justification for it should be communicable. This principle together with infinite, unique chains makes communication of knowledge difficult.**
