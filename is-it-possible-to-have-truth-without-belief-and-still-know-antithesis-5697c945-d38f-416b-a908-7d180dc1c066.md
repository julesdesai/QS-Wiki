## Content

**Consider the case where a mathematician instinctively writes down a true equation without believing in its correctness but solely on a hunch. Intuitively, one might view this as an instance of mathematical knowledge despite the absence of belief.**, **A plausible principle is that one might know something without actively forming a belief, as in the case of spontaneous insights.**
