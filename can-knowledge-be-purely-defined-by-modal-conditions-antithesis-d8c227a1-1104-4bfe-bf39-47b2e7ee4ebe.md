## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge includes a non-accidental component. This principle alongside modal safety conditions entails that knowledge might be overly restrictive in practice.**, **Suppose someone regularly updates their beliefs based on highly accurate data sources yet misses a particular nearby alternative scenario where the source errs. Intuitively, these beliefs could still be known.**
