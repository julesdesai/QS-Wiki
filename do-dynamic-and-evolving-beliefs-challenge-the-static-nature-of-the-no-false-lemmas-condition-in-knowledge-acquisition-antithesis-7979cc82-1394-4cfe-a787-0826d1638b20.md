## Content

**Think of a person whose beliefs continually develop over time, refining through error correction. Intuitively, this dynamic knowledge acquisition might conflict with static no false lemmas principles.**, **Evolving beliefs suggest that adapting and revising, even if initially based on false lemmas, can be crucial to forming true knowledge.**
