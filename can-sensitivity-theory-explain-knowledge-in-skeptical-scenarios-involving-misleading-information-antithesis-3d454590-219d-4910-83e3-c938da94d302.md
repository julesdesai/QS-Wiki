## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Bob, is in a room full of fake plants but believes there is a real plant because he thinks correctly that real plants exist in rooms like this.**, **Intuitively, we might judge that Bob doesnâ€™t know there is a real plant in the room, even though his belief is accidentally true because a real plant is there unbeknownst to him.**, **According to sensitivity theory, Bob knows there is a real plant since he believes it, the belief would not be held if the proposition were false, and it is true that a real plant is in the room.**, **The presence of misleading information, such as the fake plants, suggests that the sensitivity theory does not adequately account for the knowledge gap due to deceptively similar cases.**
