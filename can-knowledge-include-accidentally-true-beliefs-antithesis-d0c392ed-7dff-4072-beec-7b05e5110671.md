## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief by sheer luck, such as guessing the outcome of a coin flip. In this scenario, the belief is true but only due to coincidence, and intuitively we would not classify this belief as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be based on accidental truths. This principle together with the necessity for non-accidentally true belief for knowledge suggests that knowledge derived from fortunate guesses is not genuine knowledge.**
