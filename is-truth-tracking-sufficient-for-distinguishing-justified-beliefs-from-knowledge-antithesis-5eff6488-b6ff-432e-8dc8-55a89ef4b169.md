## Content

**Consider a case where a person holds a belief that tracks truth perfectly across nearby possible worlds, yet this belief is based purely on luck, such as guessing the outcome of a coin flip. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the personâ€™s belief is not knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should be distinct from lucky guesses. This principle together with tracking theory suggesting sufficiency in such cases raises a potential issue.**
