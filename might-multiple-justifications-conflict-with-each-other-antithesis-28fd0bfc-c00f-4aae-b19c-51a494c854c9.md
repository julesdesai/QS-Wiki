## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has two different justifications for a belief: one is empirical evidence supporting the belief, while another is a pragmatic consequence that seems to favor a false proposition. Intuitively, we either have to say that these justifications can coexist in knowledge, or that they lead to conflict. If we say they coexist, then it seems implausible because they point in different directions about truth.**
