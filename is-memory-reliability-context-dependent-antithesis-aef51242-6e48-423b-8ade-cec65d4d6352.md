## Content

**Suppose a person recalls a childhood event and under normal circumstances, this memory provides confident belief and the event is true. However, if the context demands verification, which the person cannot provide, then intuitively, the person does not know the event occurred, highlighting the reliance on contextual adequacy of memory.**, **It is implausible that a memory can yield knowledge in one context due to trust in recall yet fail to be knowledge in another demanding empirical confirmation. Should memory alone suffice in meeting justification requirements, the fluctuating adequacy in contexts poses a problem.**
