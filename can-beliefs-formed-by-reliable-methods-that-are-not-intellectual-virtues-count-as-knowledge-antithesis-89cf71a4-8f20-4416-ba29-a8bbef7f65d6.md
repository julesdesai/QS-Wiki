## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a belief counts as knowledge if it is formed by a reliable cognitive process.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief through a reliable process of using a lie detector machine. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the proposition detected by the machine.**, **The process of using a lie detector machine is not typically considered to be an intellectual virtue.**
