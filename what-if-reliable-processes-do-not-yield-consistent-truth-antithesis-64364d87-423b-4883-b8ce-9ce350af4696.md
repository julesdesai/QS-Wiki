## Content

**Consider person P employing a well-calibrated predictive model giving mostly accurate predictions, yet misses sporadically, like chaotic systems in weather. Though generally reliable, consistent truth variance questions the sufficiency for knowledge.**, **A principle is intervals of unreliability regularly existing alongside reliable processing question the exactness of reliability required for knowledge.**
