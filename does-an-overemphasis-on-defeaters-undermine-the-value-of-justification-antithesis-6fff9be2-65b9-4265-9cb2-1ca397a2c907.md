## Content

**Consider a situation where the defeater condition diminishes the importance of a well-established justification. Intuitively, it seems that justification should be given prominent weight in assessing knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification should hold significant value in the acquisition of knowledge. This principle together with an overemphasis on the absence of defeaters entails a devaluation of justified true beliefs.**
