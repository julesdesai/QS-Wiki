## Content

**Consider a case where a person, due to a justifiable and coherent set of beliefs, believes a proposition that is true by sheer luck or coincidence, such as in the classic "Gettier cases." Intuitively, we would judge that such lucky beliefs do not constitute knowledge despite their coherence with a personâ€™s belief system.**, **It is implausible that coherence with justificatory support alone can differentiate between mere true belief and true belief that qualifies as knowledge, because of the possibility of Gettier-style cases.**
