## Content

**It is implausible that all genuine cases of knowledge require the absence of any false assumptions. Many instances involve peripheral false assumptions that do not undermine the core belief in question.**, **Consider a situation where a person's belief is true and justified but relies indirectly on a minor false assumption that has no bearing on the truth. Intuitively, we might still consider this a case of knowledge.**
