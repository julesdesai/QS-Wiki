## Content

**There is a plausible principle that scenarios can exist where one has justified true belief, yet lack knowledge due to lucky circumstances, known as Gettier cases. This principle challenges the sufficiency of justified true belief with no defeaters for claiming knowledge.**, **Consider an example where a person has a justified true belief because of a fortunate coincidence, such as inferring the correct time from a broken clock that happens to show the right time. Intuitively, this coincidence suggests a lack of genuine knowledge.**
