## Content

**Consider that Susan sees her neighbor drive a red car every day and believes they own a red car, which is true and formed through a reliable visual process.**, **However, if Susan learns that her neighbor sells cars and changes their car color often, this new information acts as a defeater, disrupting her original belief.**, **Despite the original belief being true and formed reliably, the presence of a defeater means we might judge Susan's belief as not constituting knowledge.**
