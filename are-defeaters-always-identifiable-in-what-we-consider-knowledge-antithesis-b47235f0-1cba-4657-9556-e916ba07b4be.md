## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, they have justification, and there are no noticeable defeaters. Intuitively, it is possible that unknown defeaters could exist.**, **In such scenarios, the assumption that all defeaters can be identified or ruled out is challenged by the presence of potentially unknown defeaters.**
