**Consider a scenario where a person intensely believes a proposition emotionally (such as faith in a loved one's intention) which turns out to be true and not based on any falsehood. Intuitively, we hesitate to categorize emotionally-driven true beliefs as knowledge.**, **It is implausible that emotional conviction alone, even if leading to a true belief not structured on falsehood, is sufficient for knowledge.**
