## Content

**Suppose that someone forms a false belief on the basis of intellectual virtues like careful reasoning and reflection, but later corrects this false belief to a true one. It is implausible to argue that the presence of the intellectual virtue is irrelevant to the claim of knowledge for the later true belief.**, **Consider an example where a person initially believes incorrectly due to having weighed all the evidence through an intellectual virtue but later acquires additional evidence that corrects the belief. Intuitively, we would recognize their final belief as knowledge.**
