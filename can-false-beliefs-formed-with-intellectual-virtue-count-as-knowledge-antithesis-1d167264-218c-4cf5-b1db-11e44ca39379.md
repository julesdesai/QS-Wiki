## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, Bob, holds a belief about a historical fact, using rigorous and scrupulous historical methodology, yet the data is later found to be falsified. Intuitively, we would not consider Bob's belief to be knowledge.**
**Consider a scenario in which a belief is formed with intellectual virtue, but the proposition believed is false. Such a scenario seems not to meet the typical conditions for knowledge.**
**A plausible principle is that truth is an unyielding condition for knowledge. This principle suggests that virtuous formation alone cannot compensate for a lack of truth.**
