## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person named Sam forms a belief based on a reliable news source that a particular candidate won an election, and this belief is true because the candidate did win, yet unknown to Sam, the report was mistakenly based on a leaked, incorrect early exit poll result. Intuitively, we would judge that Sam does not know that the candidate won.**, **A case in which a person forms a belief based on accurate information but through accidentally unreliable means, like a faulty instrument that happens to show the right result, is not a case in which the person knows the result. Such a belief is justified and true, but intuitively it does not count as knowledge.**
