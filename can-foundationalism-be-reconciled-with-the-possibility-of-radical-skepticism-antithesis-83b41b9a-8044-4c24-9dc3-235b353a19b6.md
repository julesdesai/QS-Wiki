## Content

**Suppose we consider a skeptical scenario where the justification for one's basic beliefs is systematically doubted. Intuitively, without external justification, foundationalism struggles to respond adequately to this skepticism.**, **There is a plausible principle that responding to skepticism requires more than just basic beliefs. This principle together with foundationalism's reliance on basic beliefs calls its effectiveness into question.**
