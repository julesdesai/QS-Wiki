## Content

**Suppose a case where a person forms a belief using a generally reliable process, but in this instance, the process fails due to external factors unknown to the person.**, **Intuitively, if the process fails here, the belief would not constitute knowledge, even though the process is typically reliable.**, **It seems implausible that reliability alone, without awareness of its success or failure, is sufficient for knowledge.**
