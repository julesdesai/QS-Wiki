**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 95246d6b-897e-4a95-83d4-68276c808689
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge with No-Defeaters Clause](knowledge-with-no-defeaters-clause-synthesis-a1df4f71-de98-4a22-bba1-3701da6a8085.md)

## Content

**Suppose someone believes a true proposition after hearing it in a context filled with misleading information, but nothing explicitly defeats their true belief. Intuitively, such a situation challenges our idea of the person having real knowledge.**, **The presence of misleading contexts complicates our understanding of knowledge, suggesting that the mere absence of defeaters is insufficient.**
