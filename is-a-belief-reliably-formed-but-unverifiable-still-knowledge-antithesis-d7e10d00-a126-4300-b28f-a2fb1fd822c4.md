## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person relies on a generally competent source for a belief, such as a forecast that predicts no rain based on advanced meteorological models, on a day it doesnâ€™t rain but evidence about the models were inaccessible.**, **Intuitively, having no access to verifying the source challenges claims to having knowledge, even if the belief is true.**
