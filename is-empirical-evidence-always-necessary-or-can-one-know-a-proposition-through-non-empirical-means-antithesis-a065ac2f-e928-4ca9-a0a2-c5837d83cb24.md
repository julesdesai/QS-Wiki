## Content

**There is a plausible principle that empirical evidence is essential in grounding knowledge claims. This principle together with the existence of a priori knowledge entails a conflict.**, **In mathematics, instances of understanding arise that rely solely on logical deduction rather than empirical evidence. Intuitively, such scenarios suggest knowledge without empirical grounding.**
