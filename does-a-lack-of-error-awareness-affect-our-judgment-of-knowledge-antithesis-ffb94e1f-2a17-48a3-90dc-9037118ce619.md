## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a researcher's instrument is faulty, and they generate a true belief only by serendipity, unaware of the default. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know based on the outcome or consider error-awareness as necessary for knowledge. If we say they know based on the outcome, it doesn't account for the instrument's unreliability. If we factor in the lack of error-awareness, then their belief does not qualify as knowledge.**, **A true belief can be undermined as knowledge if error-prone elements in its formation are unknown to the believer.**
