## Content

**Suppose we consider early scientific methods, which were once deemed reliable but are now known to be flawed. Intuitively, it feels incorrect to claim that past thinkers 'knew' based on processes now considered unreliable.**, **There is a plausible principle that what counts as reliable can change over time, questioning whether a temporal component is missing from the reliabilist definition of knowledge.**
