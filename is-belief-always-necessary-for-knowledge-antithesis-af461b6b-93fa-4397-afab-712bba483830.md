## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has strong evidence for a true proposition but does not actively believe the proposition due to psychological resistance or oversight.**, **Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition because of the strong evidence or say they do not know because they lack belief.**, **If we say they know due to evidence, then belief seems unnecessary. If we say they do not know due to lack of belief, then strong evidence is undermined as a component of knowledge.**
