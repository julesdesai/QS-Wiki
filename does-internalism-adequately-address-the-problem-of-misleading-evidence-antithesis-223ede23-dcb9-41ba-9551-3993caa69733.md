## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has consciously accessible justification for a belief that conflicts with misleading evidence, leading them to form false beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that their claim to know is undermined by the misleading evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that misleading evidence, even if not consciously accessible, affects the justification of beliefs. This principle together with the internalist view on conscious access to justification creates tension.**, **It is implausible to assert that having justification accessible to consciousness is sufficient for knowledge, considering scenarios with misleading evidence that undermine true beliefs.**
