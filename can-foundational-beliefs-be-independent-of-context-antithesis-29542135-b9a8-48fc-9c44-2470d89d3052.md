## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a foundational belief about mathematical truths, such as 2+2=4, which remains valid across different environments and background contexts. Intuitively, these foundational beliefs are true regardless of contextual influences.**, **There is a plausible principle that some foundational beliefs are universally valid and do not rely on contextual factors. This principle together with universally accepted mathematical truths entails that certain foundational beliefs may not need contextual justification to serve as a basis for knowledge.**
