**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that their friend is at home because they see the friend's car parked outside; however, the friend is at home, but the car seen belongs to someone else. Despite the belief not being based on a falsehood, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know their friend is at home.**, **It is implausible that a true belief, not derived from any falsehood, but arrived at due to coincidental evidence, constitutes knowledge.**
