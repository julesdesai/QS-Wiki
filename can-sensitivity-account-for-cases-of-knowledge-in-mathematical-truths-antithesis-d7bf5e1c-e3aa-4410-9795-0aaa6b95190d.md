## Content

**Suppose we consider a person who knows a mathematical proposition, such as a simple arithmetic truth. Mathematical truths, being necessarily true, cannot be false. Therefore, the condition that the person would not believe the proposition if it were false cannot be evaluated. Intuitively, we still regard individuals as knowing mathematical truths despite the inapplicability of the sensitivity requirement in this context.**, **The principle that knowledge requires sensitivity suggests that knowledge claims should be contingent. However, mathematical knowledge involves necessary truths, which challenges the application of sensitivity as a criterion for knowledge.**
