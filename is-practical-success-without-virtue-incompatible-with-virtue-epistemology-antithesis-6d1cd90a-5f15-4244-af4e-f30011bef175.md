**Consider a professional who succeeds and holds true beliefs in their field due primarily to strategic habits rather than virtues.**, **Such habits might yield success and knowledge even if they don't stem from what virtue epistemology considers intellectual virtue.**, **This success seems to qualify as knowledge, yet it conflicts with a virtue-centered understanding of epistemology.**
