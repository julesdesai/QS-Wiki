## Content

**Suppose we have two isolated communities, each with a coherent, but mutually exclusive system of beliefs about a proposition. Intuitively, we cannot say that both communities possess knowledge about the proposition.**, **Coherence can lead to contradictory knowledge claims, implying that coherence alone is not a sufficient condition for knowledge.**
