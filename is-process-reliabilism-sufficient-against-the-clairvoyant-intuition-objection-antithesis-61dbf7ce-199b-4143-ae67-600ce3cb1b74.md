## Content

**Suppose we have a case of a reliable clairvoyant who consistently delivers true beliefs without any supporting evidence or understanding of the process itself. Intuitively, such "knowledge" without evidence discounts the sufficiency of reliable processes alone.**, **A principle that for a person to know, they must also have some understanding or evidence supporting their belief, is violated by the reliable clairvoyant scenario. This challenges the sufficiency component of process reliabilism.**
