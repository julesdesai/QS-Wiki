## Content

**There is a plausible principle from coherence theory that a belief must cohere with an entire system of beliefs to be justified.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a belief coheres within a specific context but contradicts other beliefs outside that context. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge, which demands consistency, is not present if a belief fails coherence.**
