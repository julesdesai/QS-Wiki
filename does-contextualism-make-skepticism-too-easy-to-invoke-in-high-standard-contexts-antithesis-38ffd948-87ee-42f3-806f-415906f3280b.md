## Content

**There is a plausible principle that skepticism should not easily disqualify knowledge in everyday contexts. This principle together with the notion that high-standard contexts can invoke skepticism suggests contextualism may permit undue skepticism.**, **Consider a scenario where a person has practical certainty in a belief, yet contextual factors impose an unnecessarily high standard of justification. Intuitively, they should retain knowledge, highlighting a shortcoming in contextualism.**
