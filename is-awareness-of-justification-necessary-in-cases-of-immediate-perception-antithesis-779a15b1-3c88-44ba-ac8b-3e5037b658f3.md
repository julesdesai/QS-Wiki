**In cases where a person sees an apple on the table, they may immediately believe that an apple is present without reflecting on their visual experience as justification.**, **The belief that there is an apple is true and perceptually justified, even if the person is not actively aware of this justification process.**, **This scenario suggests that immediate perceptual knowledge does not require awareness of justification to be considered true knowledge.**
