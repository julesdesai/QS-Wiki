## Content

**A detective reliably uses a lie detection tool that is mostly accurate in ordinary situations. However, the tool fails often in high-stress environments like courtrooms, where it still produced accurate results by accident. Intuitively, beliefs formed in such contexts would not be considered knowledge.**, **The reliability of a cognitive process forming a belief must be considered a consistent sufficiency for knowledge across varying contexts, not only in specific settings.**
