## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a casual conversation about a trivial subject suddenly shifts to a more serious tone because an expert enters the room. Intuitively, it's strange to think that this mere change in conversational dynamics alters whether the participants know facts about the trivial subject.**, **If conversational context is so fluid that knowledge standards shift rapidly and with ease, this could create instability in what is considered knowledge at any moment.**
