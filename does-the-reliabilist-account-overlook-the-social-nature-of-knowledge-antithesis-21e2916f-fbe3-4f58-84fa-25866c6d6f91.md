## Content

**Suppose a person forms their belief based on information disseminated through a well-established social network, yet the individual processes within the network are not collectively reliable. Intuitively, this does not seem to disqualify the belief from being knowledge.**, **A plausible consideration is that social epistemic practices often play a crucial role in forming knowledge, questioning the individual-centered focus of process reliabilism.**
