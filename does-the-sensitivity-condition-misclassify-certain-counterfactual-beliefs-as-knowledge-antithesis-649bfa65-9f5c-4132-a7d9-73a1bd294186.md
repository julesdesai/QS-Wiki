## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Martha has a lucky belief about a contestant winning a game show. Martha believes contestant B will win due to gut feeling without strong evidence. Contestant B actually wins, but if contestant B had not won, Martha would not believe it due to after-the-fact rationalization. Intuitively, we would not consider Martha to know the outcome, even though the sensitivity condition is met.**, **Sensitivity requires that if proposition p were false, the belief in proposition p would not occur. With Martha's belief, despite meeting this condition, we perceive a lack of justification for claiming knowledge.**
