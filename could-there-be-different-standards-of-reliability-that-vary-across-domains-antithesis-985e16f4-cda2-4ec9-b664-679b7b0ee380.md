## Content

**Consider belief formation in mathematics versus belief formation in art criticism, where the reliability of processes might differ significantly. Intuitively, a uniform requirement of process reliability seems inadequate to both contexts.**, **The appropriateness of reliability standards might depend on the nature of the belief domain, posing a challenge to the rigid application of process reliabilism.**
