## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a vivid and continuous experience of a particular event transpiring, such as watching a sunrise. In such a scenario, intuitively, the person seems to have knowledge of the event.**, **There is a plausible principle that direct experiential evidence is sufficient for knowledge. The sensitivity demand suggests this evidence is not enough if false beliefs could still arise under the same perceptual conditions, which is counterintuitive.**
