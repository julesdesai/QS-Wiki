## Content

**Consider a scenario where Lisa is a trained, accurate archer who shoots an arrow that hits the target because of a sudden gust of wind. Intuitively, we question whether she knew she would hit the target despite her expertise.**, **In this scenario, although Lisa's performance is apt, external factors played a significant role in the result.**, **This suggests that an apt performance might not be sufficient for constituting knowledge if external factors are crucial to the outcome.**
