## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a true belief from a reliable process but has no understanding of the process's complexity or justification beyond its mere reliability. Intuitively, there is a strong sense that such absence of deeper understanding is insufficient for a complete claim to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that true belief, reliability, and understanding are distinct requirements for knowledge, pointing to a trichotomy where understanding adds an essential layer separate from reliability.**
