## Content

**There is a plausible principle that coherence implies a check for internal consistency. This principle together with the fact that human cognition easily overlooks internal contradictions entails that contextual standards might approve false knowledge.**, **Our intuitive reaction to discovering internal contradictions is to reassess claimed knowledge, showing coherence dependency.**
