## Content

**Suppose a person knows a mathematical truth, like basic arithmetic facts, but this knowledge lacks a causal chain to the abstraction of numbers. Intuitively, we understand these truths without causal processes.**, **There is a plausible principle that logical and mathematical knowledge does not require causal connections since such truths are derived from reasoning rather than empirical causation.**
