## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, but their belief is based on an unreliable or false basis that accidentally leads to truth. Intuitively, we either have to say that this case is not knowledge or redefine safety. If we say it's not knowledge, the notion of nearby possible worlds in the safety condition seems challenged.**
