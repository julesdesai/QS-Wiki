## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition because they possess reliable mechanisms that tend to produce true beliefs, but the person's belief is true by mere chance in this particular instance. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that they do not. If we say the person knows, it challenges the necessity of tracking. If we say they do not know, it challenges the sufficiency of tracking.**
