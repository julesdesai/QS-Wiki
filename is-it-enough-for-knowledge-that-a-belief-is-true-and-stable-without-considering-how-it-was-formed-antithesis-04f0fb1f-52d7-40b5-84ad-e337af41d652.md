## Content

**Visualize a case of someone who believes a true proposition with stable external support but the belief arose through sheer luck or guessing. It seems counterintuitive to call this knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that the process by which a belief is formed plays a crucial role in it being knowledge. Purely external stability might neglect this aspect, challenging its sufficiency for knowledge.**
