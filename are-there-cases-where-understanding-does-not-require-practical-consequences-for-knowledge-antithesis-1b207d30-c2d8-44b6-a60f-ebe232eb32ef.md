## Content

**Consider a scenario where an astrophysicist understands complex theories about the origins of the universe, but this understanding has no practical application in daily life. Intuitively, we would judge that the astrophysicist knows these theories despite the lack of practical consequences.**, **It is implausible that understanding must have practical consequences for it to contribute to knowledge.**
