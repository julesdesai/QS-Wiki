## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a single belief that coheres with no other beliefs but is still true. Intuitively, this single belief should not be considered knowledge due to lack of interconnectedness.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence requires a network of beliefs, not isolated ones. This principle together with an isolated true belief challenges the necessity of coherence for knowledge.**
