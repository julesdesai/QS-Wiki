## Content

**It is implausible that merely having a belief that is true and formed through a reliable process suffices for knowledge since this does not consider the additional context or challenges, such as accidental truth or external interferences.**, **Consider a scenario where every condition but the reliability of the true belief suggests an accidental truth, such as randomly guessing the outcome of a coin toss correctly. Intuitively, the correct guess does not amount to knowledge despite the belief being true.**
