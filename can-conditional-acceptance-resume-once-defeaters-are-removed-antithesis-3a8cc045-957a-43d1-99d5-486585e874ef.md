## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person temporarily suspends a true belief due to known defeaters and then resumes belief once defeaters are disproved.**, **Intuitively, the resumption of belief post-defeater implies knowledge can be conditionally suspended.**, **The idea that removing defeaters validates renewed belief confronts the consistency required between belief, justification, and the presence of defeaters.**
