## Content

**Consider a case where a person claims to have knowledge based on intuition rather than explicit intellectual virtue. In such a scenario, intuitively, the claim that intuition itself suffices for knowledge challenges the necessity of a reliable process.**, **It is implausible to say that knowledge always requires an explicit intellectual virtue if intuition sometimes appears to produce immediate knowledge convincingly.**
