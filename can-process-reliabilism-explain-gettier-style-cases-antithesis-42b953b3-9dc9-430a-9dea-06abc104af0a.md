## Content

**Consider a case where a person forms a belief through a reliable process, producing true belief, yet the belief's truth is due to unexpected byproducts or inference errors resolving luckily. Intuitively, these Gettier-type scenarios do not seem to yield genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief, even if reliably formed, isn't knowledge if its truth is incidentally achieved through errors or misleading reasoning. Gettier cases challenge the sufficiency of reliabilism by showing that true belief plus reliability can still fall short of knowledge.**
