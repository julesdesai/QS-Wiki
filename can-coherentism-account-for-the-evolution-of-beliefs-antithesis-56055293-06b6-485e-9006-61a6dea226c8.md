## Content

**There is a plausible principle that human understanding improves through revising and updating beliefs. This principle together with a static coherent system implies that 'frozen' coherent beliefs cannot account for the dynamic nature of knowledge.**, **Suppose a scientist revises her beliefs in light of new evidence. Intuitively, the adaptability and evolution of beliefs should be a feature of a knowledge system.**
