## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone correctly believes the time based on looking at a stopped clock that just so happens to show the right time. Intuitively, the person does not know the correct time.**, **There may be a nearby possible situation where the clock is regularly accurate, suggesting the belief should be considered knowledge.**, **It is implausible that mere chance alignment in nearby possible situations could differentiate knowledge from mere belief.**
