## Content

**Consider a student who concludes a geometrical theorem correctly based on a proof involving an incorrect assumption about a peripheral historical fact unrelated to geometry. Intuitively, the false historical fact does not impede their knowledge of the theorem.**, **Knowledge appears robust when supported by direct and core evidential premises; incorrect belief about non-core premises may not necessarily defeat it.**
