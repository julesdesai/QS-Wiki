## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which P's belief counterfactually depends on the truth of a proposition, and P encounters irrelevant alternatives that don't affect the truth but create doubt. Intuitively, we might say P knows less after encountering these alternatives.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should remain stable if the truth conditions remain unchanged. If encountering irrelevant possibilities causes loss of knowledge, counterfactual dependence could be insufficient.**, **It seems implausible that mere exposure to irrelevant scenarios invalidates the counterfactual basis of knowledge.**
