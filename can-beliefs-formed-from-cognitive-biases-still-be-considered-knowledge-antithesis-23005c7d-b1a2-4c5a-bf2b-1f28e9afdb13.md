## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a cognitive bias, such as confirmation bias, and this belief is true. Intuitively, we might judge that this person does not have knowledge.**, **A case in which a person forms a belief due to bias, the belief is true, and the faculties are operating in a way that leads to systematic bias, challenges the sufficiency of proper function for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that beliefs stemming from cognitive biases, which are systematic and subconscious deviations from rationality, satisfy the condition of faculties properly functioning toward truth.**
