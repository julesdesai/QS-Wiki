**Suppose someone sees what appears to be a barn and believes it is a barn; it turns out there are many fake barns in the area, though their belief is true. Intuitively, one might not say they know the object is a barn.**, **The belief that there is a barn in the presence of many fake barns may not track the truth well across possible situations.**, **In nearby possible worlds, the observer's belief could easily have been false if they looked at one of the fake barns.**
