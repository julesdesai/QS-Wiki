## Content

**The mathematical proposition "2 + 2 = 4" is necessarily true; it cannot be false in any possible world.**, **If knowing a proposition requires that one would not believe it if it were false, then for the proposition "2 + 2 = 4," there is no possible world where it is false for a test of belief to occur.**, **Intuitively, a person can know mathematical truths like "2 + 2 = 4," even though these cannot be false for the sensitivity condition to apply.**
