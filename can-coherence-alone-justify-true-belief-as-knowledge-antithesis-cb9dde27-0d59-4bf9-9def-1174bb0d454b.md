## Content

**It is implausible that mere coherence of a belief with a person's other beliefs can suffice for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person has a coherent belief network that is systematically based on false memories or misinformation. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that they do not have knowledge.**
