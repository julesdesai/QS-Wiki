## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief based on an obscure foundational claim that is coherent but extreme, such as "All swans are computer simulations." Intuitively, we would judge that such a belief does not count as knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence with an extreme foundational claim should lead to justified belief or knowledge due to the inaccessibility or implausibility of the foundational set.**
