## Content

**In Gettier-style scenarios, a person holds a justified true belief, yet due to some element of luck, the belief's truth depends on coincidences**, **For example, an employee believes the CEO owns a particular car based on seeing an identical car in the office parking lot, yet it turns out the car is owned by someone else, and the CEO coincidentally owns the same model in another city**, **In such scenarios, a belief may meet the tripartite requirement of belief, truth, and safety from being false and still fail to qualify as knowledge due to the coincidental factors involved**
