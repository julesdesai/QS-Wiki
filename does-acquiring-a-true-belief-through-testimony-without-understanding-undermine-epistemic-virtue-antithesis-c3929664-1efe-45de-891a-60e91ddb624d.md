## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based solely on someone else's testimony without any understanding of the proposition itself. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not truly know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that understanding is a component of epistemic virtue. This principle together with relying solely on testimony entails that knowledge requires an understanding of the proposition.**
