## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a belief that is true and formed through a reliable process but holds no personal certainty about it, such as a complex mathematical theorem verified by an expert but not understood by the believer. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge may also require a degree of subjective certainty.**, **There is a plausible principle that personal certainty or conviction is necessary for a belief to count as knowledge, beyond truth and reliability.**
