## Content

**Under contextualism, the truth required for knowledge can depend on conversational context, creating the possibility of relative rather than universal truth. Intuitively, knowledge has traditionally been considered to involve universal truths rather than context-dependent truths.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, which relies on truth, would suggest relativism regarding truth rather than universality, which is its traditionally fundamental aspect.**
