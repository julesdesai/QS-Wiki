## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition based solely on a random guess. The proposition is true, and there are no false assumptions. Intuitively, we would not consider this a case of knowledge because the belief's truth is purely accidental.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be based on accidental truths.**
