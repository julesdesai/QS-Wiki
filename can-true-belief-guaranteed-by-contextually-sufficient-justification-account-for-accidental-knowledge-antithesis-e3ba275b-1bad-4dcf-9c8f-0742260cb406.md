## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief about a fact due to a contextually sufficient but entirely lucky or coincidental justification. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not count as knowledge despite meeting contextual standards of justification.**, **A true belief formed through sheer coincidence or luck does not intuitively align with the concept of knowledge, even if contextually appropriate.**
