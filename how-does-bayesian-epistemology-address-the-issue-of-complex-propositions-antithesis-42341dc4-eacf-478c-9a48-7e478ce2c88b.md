## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has justified beliefs regarding basic propositions but lacks the ability to perform complex probabilistic reasoning for more intricate propositions. Intuitively, we might still regard them as having knowledge of these complex propositions through reliable inference.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge of complex propositions can be derived from knowledge of simpler propositions through inference, even if the inferences are not explicitly probabilistic.**
