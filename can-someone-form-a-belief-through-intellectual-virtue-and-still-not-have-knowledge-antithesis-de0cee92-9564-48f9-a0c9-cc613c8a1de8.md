## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person reliably forms a belief that it is raining outside by looking at a digital weather display, which is malfunctioning but coincidentally correct. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A person forming a belief through intellectual virtue would typically involve using reliable cognitive faculties or processes. In the malfunctioning display case, we question whether the belief was truly formed through intellectual virtue.**
