## Content

**Consider an example where believing a comforting but false narrative has great pragmatic benefits, like fostering hope or cohesion, yet lacks epistemic responsibility by disregarding evidence. Intuitively, there's tension between maintaining epistemic integrity and maximizing pragmatic utility.**, **While pragmatic usefulness is considered valuable yet non-essential, if it significantly aids or motivates beliefs, it conflicts with the ideal of epistemic responsibility, which prioritizes correct beliefs based on evidence above practical effectiveness.**
