## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition by sheer accident, despite using a process they believe is reliable, while in reality, it is not. Intuitively, we would judge that they lack knowledge because their belief stems from an unreliable source.**, **A plausible principle suggests that a definition of knowledge requiring process reliability must account for the actual efficacy of the process, not merely the individual's perception of it. This principle suggests that true belief derived under mistaken trust in a process does not constitute knowledge.**
