## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition by mere luck, and not through any reliability of their intellectual virtues. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is implausible that any true belief produced by intellectual virtue must necessarily constitute knowledge, as there are cases where true beliefs come from lucky guesses rather than reliable processes.**
