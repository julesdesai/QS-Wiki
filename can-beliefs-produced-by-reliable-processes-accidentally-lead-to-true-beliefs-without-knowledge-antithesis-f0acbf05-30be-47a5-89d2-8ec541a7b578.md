**Suppose we have a case in which a person takes a medication based on her doctor’s reliable judgment that it is noon, and it happens to be noon, but her belief is based on reading a randomly set clock. Intuitively, we would say she accidentally arrived at the truth and doesn’t know the time.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person takes a medication based on her doctor’s reliable judgment that it is noon, and it happens to be noon, but her belief is based on reading a randomly set clock. This is a case where the belief aligns with a reliable cognitive process.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person takes a medication based on her doctor’s reliable judgment that it is noon, and it happens to be noon, but her belief is based on reading a randomly set clock.
