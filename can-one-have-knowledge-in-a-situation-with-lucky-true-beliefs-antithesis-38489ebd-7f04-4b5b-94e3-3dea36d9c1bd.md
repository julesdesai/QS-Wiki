## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person guesses the answer to a question correctly because of sheer luck. Intuitively, we either have to say that this is knowledge or that it is not knowledge. If we say it is knowledge, then we violate common intuitions about knowledge requiring more than luck. If we say it is not knowledge, then reliability alone cannot be enough for knowledge.**
