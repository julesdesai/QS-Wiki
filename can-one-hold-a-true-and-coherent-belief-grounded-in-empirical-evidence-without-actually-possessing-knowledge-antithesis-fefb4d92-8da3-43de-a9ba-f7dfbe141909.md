## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a true belief that is coherent with their other beliefs and based on empirical evidence, but the process of belief formation was largely accidental. Intuitively, we might judge that the belief is not knowledge.**, **Suppose a person fortuitously stumbles upon a true belief that empirically aligns with their previous beliefs. Intuitively, this might not count as knowledge due to lack of careful justification.**
