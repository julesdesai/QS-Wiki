## Content

**To know a proposition, a person must have a justified belief that meets contextual standards, but justifications can vary widely across contexts. This potentially complicates understanding of what constitutes sufficient justification.**, **It is implausible for the justification of a belief to differ so greatly based on context, as usually, justification should depend more on the evidence itself than situational factors.**
