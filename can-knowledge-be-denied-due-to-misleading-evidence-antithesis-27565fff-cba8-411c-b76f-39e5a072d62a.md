## Content

**Suppose a person arrives at a belief based on misleading evidence but the belief is true and causally connected to the truth because of an error unrelated to their evidence. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief constitutes knowledge or that it does not. If we say it constitutes knowledge, then the misleading evidence and lack of awareness challenge the sufficiency of the causal connection. If we say it does not, then causation is insufficient when the subject's evidential basis is flawed.**
