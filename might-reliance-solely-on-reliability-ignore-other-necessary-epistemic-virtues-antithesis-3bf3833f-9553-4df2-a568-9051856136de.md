## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is formed reliably but lacks intellectual virtues like open-mindedness or intellectual courage. Intuitively, we either have to say that such belief is knowledge or that it is not. If we say it is knowledge, then such virtues are deemed irrelevant. If we say it is not, then reliance upon reliability alone is insufficient.**, **Foregoing the inclusion of necessary intellectual virtues, such as thorough reflection, results in beliefs that fail to achieve knowledge despite reliability.**
