## Content

**Suppose there is a case where a person believes a true proposition with adequate justification based on context, but the proposition's truth is coincidentally unrelated to their justification. Intuitively, such a case lacks the causal connection and therefore cannot be knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario of a lucky guess that happens to align with contextual justification and truth. Intuitively, luck undermines the claim to knowledge.**
