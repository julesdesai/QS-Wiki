## Content

**Consider a scenario in which person P believes proposition Q, Q is true, and defeaters depend on varying context.**, **In different contexts, what counts as a defeater may shift, affecting the consistency of P's knowledge claim.**, **The context-dependence implies a variability that undermines the reliability of defeaters as a stable criterion for knowledge.**
