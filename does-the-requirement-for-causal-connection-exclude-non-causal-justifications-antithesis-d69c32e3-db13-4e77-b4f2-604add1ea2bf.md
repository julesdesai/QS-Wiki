## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a mathematical truth solely based on logical reasoning, with no causal interaction. Intuitively, this is a case of knowledge that lacks causal connection.**, **There is a plausible principle that purely logical or conceptual knowledge needs no causal explanation. This principle suggests knowledge can exist independently of causal connections.**
