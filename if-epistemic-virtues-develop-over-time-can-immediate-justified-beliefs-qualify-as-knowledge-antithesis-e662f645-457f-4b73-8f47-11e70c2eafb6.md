## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person immediately acquires a true belief through an initial application of epistemic virtues which are not yet fully developed. Intuitively, we either have to say that this immediate belief counts as knowledge or not. If we say it counts as knowledge, it challenges the idea that mature epistemic virtues are necessary for knowledge.**
