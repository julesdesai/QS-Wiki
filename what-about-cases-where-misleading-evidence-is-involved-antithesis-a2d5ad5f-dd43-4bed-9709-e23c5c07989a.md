## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a truthful proposition based on misleading evidence that they later find to be unreliable, yet the belief remains. The sensitivity condition emphasizes a connection between belief and truth, yet in this scenario, the truthfulness is incidental and not due to reliable sensitivity. Intuitively, it seems that a mistake about the evidence does not necessarily undermine the knowledge.**, **It is implausible that sensitivity, which demands conditional dependence on the truth, can properly address cases where beliefs remain true despite being formed on unreliable grounds.**
