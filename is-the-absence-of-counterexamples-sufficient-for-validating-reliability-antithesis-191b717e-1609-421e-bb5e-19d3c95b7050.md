## Content

**Suppose a situation in which no actual counterexamples exist for a generally reliable process within a limited scope, like a flawlessly working watch that lacks independent testing.**, **Intuitively, such lack of counterexamples is not sufficient for constituting knowledge, because reliability has not been adequately assessed.**
