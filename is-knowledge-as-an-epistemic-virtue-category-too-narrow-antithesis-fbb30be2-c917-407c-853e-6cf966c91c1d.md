## Content

**It is implausible that epistemic virtues are the only relevant factors in assessing knowledge, as people often require additional practical wisdom or context, such as ethical considerations, to be truly knowledgeable.**, **Consider a scenario where a person possesses all relevant epistemic virtues but lacks situational awareness or ethical insight, leading to misconceptions. Intuitively, such a person might be judged as not fully knowledgeable despite meeting epistemic criteria.**
