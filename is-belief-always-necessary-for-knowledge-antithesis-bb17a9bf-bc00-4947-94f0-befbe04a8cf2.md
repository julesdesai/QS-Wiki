## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person acts in a way that perfectly mimics knowledge, such as consistently giving correct answers without internal belief. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person has knowledge despite the absence of belief.**, **It is plausible that in certain cases, the action or behavior reflecting a grasp of truth suffices for attributing knowledge, challenging the necessity of belief for knowledge.**
