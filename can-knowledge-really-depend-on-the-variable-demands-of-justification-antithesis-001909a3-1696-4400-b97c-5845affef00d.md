## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two individuals witness the same event, but different social contexts require different standards of justification for their knowledge claims about the event. Intuitively, both individuals witnessed the event under identical conditions and should equally possess knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the factual circumstances of witnessing the event remain the same, yet one individual knows while the other does not, due purely to contextually imposed justification standards.**
