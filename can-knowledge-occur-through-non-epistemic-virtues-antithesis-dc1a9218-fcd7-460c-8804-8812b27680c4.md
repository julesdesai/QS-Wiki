## Content

**Suppose a person derives a true belief not through cognitive virtues but through moral or physical virtues, such as kindness or strength. Intuitively, we might still judge them to know the truth, especially if their actions led reliably to true beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that non-epistemic virtues can contribute to or result in the acquisition of knowledge. This principle together with the truth and reliability of the belief entails that the belief may constitute knowledge.**
