## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition about a bank being open on Saturday in a low-stakes context where no significant consequence relies on it. Later, when the stakes are high and they risk losing important documents, they still hold the same true belief. Intuitively, it seems they have knowledge in both cases.**, **There is a plausible principle that stakes should not necessarily affect the possession of knowledge when the belief remains stable and true.**
