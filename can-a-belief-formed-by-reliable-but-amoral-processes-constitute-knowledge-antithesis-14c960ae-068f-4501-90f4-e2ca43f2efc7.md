## Content

**Suppose a person arrives at a true belief through a process that is reliable but not driven by intellectual virtue, such as a reliable but mechanical computational process. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not truly know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that if knowledge arises from an intellectual virtue, the process should embody a distinctively intellectual effort or skill. A mechanical process lacks any intellectual engagement or virtue, thus failing this requirement.**
