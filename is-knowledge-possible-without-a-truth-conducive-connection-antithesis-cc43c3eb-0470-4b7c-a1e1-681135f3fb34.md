## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition but their belief is based on a lucky guess. Intuitively, we would not say that this person knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot arise from mere luck or coincidence. This principle together with the claim that only a truth-conducive connection is sufficient for knowledge suggests a conflict in cases of lucky guesses.**
