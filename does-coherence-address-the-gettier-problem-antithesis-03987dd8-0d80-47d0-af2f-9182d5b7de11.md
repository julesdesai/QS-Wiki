## Content

**Suppose we have a Gettier case where all beliefs are coherent, the proposition is true, and the belief is held, but for the wrong reasons. Intuitively, such cases suggest the absence of knowledge because of the incorrect causal chain.**, **There is a plausible principle that having truth and belief within a coherent system does not suffice if the justification arises from faulty premises. This principle together with the absence of error consideration in coherentism entails it cannot solve the Gettier problem.**
