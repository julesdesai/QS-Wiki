## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a novel process is used to form beliefs that turns out to be reliable only by unknown luck. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that reliance on an untested and unknown process for knowledge is problematic.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires at least some prior epistemic warrant for trust in a new reliable process besides its mere reliability.**
