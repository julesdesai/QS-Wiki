## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is a brain in a vat and all their beliefs about the external world are induced artificially. Intuitively, we would judge that their beliefs are not knowledge because their beliefs would remain the same even if they were true about the real world.**, **In skeptical scenarios, one's beliefs may be unwarranted because they lack a connection to an actual, interacting reality, compromising their status as knowledge.**
