## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person remembers that a certain historical fact is true, such as when a war ended. If the person were prompted with a counterfactual where the war ended at a different time, their belief would not change because it was formed in memory. Intuitively we would judge that their belief is still knowledge.**, **Memory beliefs can remain constant even under hypothetical false scenarios due to their resilient nature, challenging the idea that knowing requires a belief that would change if false.**
