## Content

**Suppose there is a case in which someone believes a bridge will collapse because of a rumor, and subsequently the bridge collapses due to structural failure. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know about the collapse despite their belief being true, as the causal chain from belief to fact lacks a rational basis.**, **It is implausible that knowledge claims are sufficiently grounded merely by the presence of any causal chain.**
