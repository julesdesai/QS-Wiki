## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a cognitive process is generally reliable but in this instance produces a belief that is true purely by coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must not only be produced by a reliable process but also be causally related to the fact that makes the belief true. This principle together with the scenario entails that a belief can be true and produced by a reliable process yet fail to be knowledge.**
