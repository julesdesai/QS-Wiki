## Content

**Consider a situation in which an individual uses some reasoning based on a false belief, but the conclusion they reach is nonetheless reliable and accurate about the proposition. Intuitively, it seems plausible that false beliefs do not always disqualify one from having knowledge, particularly when they do not affect the reliability of the conclusion.**
