## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a true belief with a causal basis unknown to them or the process is unobservable. Intuitively, belief seems to lack the assertion of knowledge due to the unawareness of its causality.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires awareness of the causal connection. This challenges the view that all knowledge involves consciously perceived causality.**
