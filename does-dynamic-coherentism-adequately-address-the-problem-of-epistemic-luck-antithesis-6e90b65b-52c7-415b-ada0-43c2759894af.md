## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone acquires a true belief through a lucky guess that happens to fit their evolving belief system. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge or they do not. If we say they have knowledge, then we admit luck as a basis for knowledge, which seems problematic. If we say they do not have knowledge, then coherence alone cannot be sufficient for knowledge.**
