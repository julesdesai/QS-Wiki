## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person trusts a source based on shared cultural, social, or political biases, which conveys a true proposition aligned with this bias. Intuitively, we would judge that despite the proposition's truth, the knowledge attribution is questionable due to bias-based trust rather than objective evaluation.**, **It is implausible under a view of knowledge as objective that biases grounded in social or cultural affiliations can serve as reliable foundations for what constitutes knowledge.**
