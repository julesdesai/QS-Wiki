## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a reliable source. However, the belief is true due to a coincidence unrelated to the source. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief is not only true because of coincidence, but because of a reliable connection to the truth of the proposition.**
