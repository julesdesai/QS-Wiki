## Content

**Consider a case where an individual has a belief that is coherent with their system, which is largely made up of false beliefs, such as widespread conspiracy theories. Intuitively, we would judge that coherence with false beliefs does not constitute knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that true knowledge cannot be derived or justified solely from a system dominated by false beliefs even if coherent. This principle challenges whether coherence with mostly false beliefs can ever amount to knowledge.**
