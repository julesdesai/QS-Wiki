## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person in one context is justified by testimonial evidence, while in a more skeptical context, physical evidence is required. Intuitively, our sense of what justification requires should not necessarily change outright due to mere contextual differences.**, **There is a plausible principle that what constitutes justification should be stable across contexts. Variability may lead to epistemic inconsistency.**
