## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through a normally reliable process, but in a particular instance, the belief is actually false yet corrected by chance in an unrelated way. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge since the apparent reliability is undermined by the coincidental nature of truth.**
