## Content

**Imagine a person who believes for no good reason that a horse will win a race, and the horse indeed wins because of factors no one anticipated.**, **While the belief is true due to a coincidence, it appears implausible to regard the person as having had knowledge of the outcome.**, **This suggests that coincidences leading to true beliefs do not meet the criteria we typically associate with knowledge.**
