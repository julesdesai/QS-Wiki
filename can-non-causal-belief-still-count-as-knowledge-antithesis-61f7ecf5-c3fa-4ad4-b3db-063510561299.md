## Content

**Suppose a person has a belief that is true and formed due to reliable evidence, but not causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true. Intuitively, we might still consider this as knowledge.**, **It is plausible to assume that a belief can align with reality due to its reliability, even if there is no direct causal connection between the belief and the fact that makes it true.**
