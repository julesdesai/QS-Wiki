## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's true belief arises from epistemic virtues, yet external circumstances greatly influence the truth of the belief in ways unknown to the person. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or not. If we say the person knows the proposition, it conflicts with the idea that knowledge should not be subject to luck or unrelated external conditions.**
