## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a method that is generally reliable but fails under certain specific conditions, which the person is unaware of, leading to a false belief. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge depends on contextual awareness of conditions affecting reliability.**, **There is a plausible principle that the reliability of a belief-forming process requires sensitivity to context-specific factors to truly warrant knowledge.**
