## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief coheres with a foundational set of beliefs solely due to lucky alignment, this belief should not be considered knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief coheres with independently justified foundational beliefs purely by chance. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge.**
