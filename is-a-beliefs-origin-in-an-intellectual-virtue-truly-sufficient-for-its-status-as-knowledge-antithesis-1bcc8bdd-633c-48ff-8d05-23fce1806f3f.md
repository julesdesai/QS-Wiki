## Content

**Consider a case in which a belief arises from an intellectual virtue but the reasons for holding the belief are flawed or mistaken. Intuitively, we would judge that the presence of the intellectual virtue alone does not suffice for the belief to count as knowledge.**, **Imagine a situation where a person exercises deep intellectual contemplation, leading to a belief based on outdated or incorrect information. It seems that this belief should not be considered knowledge despite the involvement of an intellectual virtue.**
