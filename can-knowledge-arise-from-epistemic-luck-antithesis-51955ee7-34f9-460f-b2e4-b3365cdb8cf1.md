## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alex, forms a belief about the location of her lost keys through a random guess, which turns out to be true. In this scenario, the belief is true and resulted in accurate knowledge, but it does not arise from an intellectual virtue or ability. Intuitively, this does not seem like a case of genuine knowledge, even though the belief is true.**
