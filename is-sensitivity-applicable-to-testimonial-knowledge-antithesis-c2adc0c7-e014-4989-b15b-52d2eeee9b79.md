## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a proposition solely based on another’s testimony, like learning someone’s name from them. Intuitively, we would judge that the person has knowledge even if the belief would not change under hypothetical false scenarios due to trust in testimony.**, **Testimonial knowledge often relies on trust and is less about sensitivity, highlighting a potential gap where sensitive belief may not capture all forms of knowledge acquisition.**
