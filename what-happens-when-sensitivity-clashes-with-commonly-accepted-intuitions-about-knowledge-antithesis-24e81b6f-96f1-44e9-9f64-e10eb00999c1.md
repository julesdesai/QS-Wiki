## Content

**Consider a situation where a person holds a true belief about the weather based on a reliable forecast. If the forecast had predicted differently, the person would not have believed the actual weather condition, despite now holding a true belief. Intuitively, this person is seen as knowing the weather.**, **Sensitivity demands that people who are generally seen as knowing something do not qualify as having knowledge because their belief fails a subjunctive condition, which leads to counterintuitive results.**
