## Content

**Consider a scenario where a mountaineer claims to know that a route is safe based on personal experience in an extremely relaxed informal context. In a formal context where safety measures are emphasized, the same claim lacks adequate justification. This raises the question of exaggerated differences in standards.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification standards should not vary so greatly as to exaggerate differences in knowledge claims in extreme contexts. The contextualist approach may lead to imbalances that distort genuine knowledge assertions.**
