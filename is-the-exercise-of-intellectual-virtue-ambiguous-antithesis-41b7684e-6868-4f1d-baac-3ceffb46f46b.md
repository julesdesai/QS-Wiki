## Content

**It is implausible that the exercise of intellectual virtue can be easily delineated in all cases. For instance, if a person acquires a true belief through means that seem to be a blend of virtue and luck, then it becomes difficult to categorize the nature of the knowledge clearly and to decide if knowledge is present.**
