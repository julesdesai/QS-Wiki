## Content

**It is possible for a person to have a coherent belief system that is entirely based on false information.**, **Suppose a person believes that every detail they know about the world is given by a deceptive but coherent virtual reality, then their coherent belief system might be systematically false.**, **If coherence alone is considered sufficient for knowledge, then the beliefs of a person in this virtual reality would count as knowledge, even though this contradicts the requirement of truth in knowledge.**
