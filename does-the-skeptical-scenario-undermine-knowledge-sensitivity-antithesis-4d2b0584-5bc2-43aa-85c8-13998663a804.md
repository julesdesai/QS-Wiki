## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is a brain in a vat, and all their experiences are indistinguishable from reality. In this scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge about the external world despite having justified true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires sensitivity to the truth of the proposition. In this scenario, the sensitivity condition fails because if the external propositions were false, the person would still form the same beliefs.**
