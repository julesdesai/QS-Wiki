## Content

**Consider a scenario where a student believes they will pass an exam based on their current grades and consistent study habits. The proposition that they will pass is true since they do pass. However, in nearby possible situations, they could easily fail if, for example, they fall ill or the exam difficulty is unexpectedly high. Intuitively, we would not categorize the student's belief as knowledge because the belief could easily turn false.**
