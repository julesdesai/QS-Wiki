## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition, and the belief coheres with a foundational set of justified basic beliefs that are false. Intuitively, we either have to say that coherence with false beliefs can lead to knowledge or that it cannot. If we say coherence with false beliefs can lead to knowledge, then we risk allowing false knowledge. If we say coherence with false beliefs cannot lead to knowledge, then coherence is not sufficient for knowledge.**
