## Content

**Suppose an individual makes a knowledge claim suitable in an initial casual context but finds it challenged when the context changes to a more academic one. Intuitively, this transition questions the stability of knowledge claims across different settings.**, **There is a plausible principle that once someone knows something, any context shift should not invalidate that knowledge without significant changes to evidence or reasoning.**
