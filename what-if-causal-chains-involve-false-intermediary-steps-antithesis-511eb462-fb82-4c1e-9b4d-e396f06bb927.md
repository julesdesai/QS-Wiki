## Content

**Suppose a person comes to a true belief through a causal chain that includes false beliefs as intermediary steps. Intuitively, it seems wrong to say the final belief constitutes knowledge.**, **It seems plausible that a belief cannot constitute knowledge if derived from an erroneous causal chain, even if the end belief is true.**
