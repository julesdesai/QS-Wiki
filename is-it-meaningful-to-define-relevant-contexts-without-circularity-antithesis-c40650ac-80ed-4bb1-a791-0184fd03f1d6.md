## Content

**There is a plausible principle that defining 'relevant contexts' involves making reference to the very idea of knowledge or understanding, leading to circularity.**, **A context of a professor challenging a student's belief seems relevant, yet defining it within the terms of the theory might presuppose existing knowledge. This leads to difficulties in specifically identifying which contexts qualify without reference to knowledge.**
