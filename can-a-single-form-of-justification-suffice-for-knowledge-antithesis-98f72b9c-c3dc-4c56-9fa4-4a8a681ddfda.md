## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sincerely believes a true proposition based solely on strong empirical evidence. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person has knowledge even though there is only one form of justification.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires multiple forms of justification when a robust single form of justification is present.**
