## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition based solely on coherence without any reliable method or evidence linking the belief to the world. Intuitively, we might say that the person lacks knowledge.**, **The principle that knowledge requires a reliable method of belief formation suggests that coherence alone, without such reliability, fails to provide knowledge.**
