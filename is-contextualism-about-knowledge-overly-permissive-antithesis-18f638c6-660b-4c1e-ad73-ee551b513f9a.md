## Content

**Consider a scenario where low standards for knowing are present in a context, permitting someone to claim knowledge based on very little evidence. Intuitively, it seems wrong that such minimal evidence should result in knowledge.**, **It is implausible that merely adjusting contextual standards, without changing the evidence, should determine knowledge.**
