**Consider the proposition that 2+2=4, which is necessarily true in all possible worlds. One cannot sensibly imagine the truth of this proposition being otherwise and failing to believe it.**, **If a person knows 2+2=4, then the sensitivity condition that if it were false, they would not believe it, fails because there is no possible world in which it is false.**
