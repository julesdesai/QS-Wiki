## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which the contextual standards are exceptionally high, requiring absolute certainty for justification. Intuitively, few if any knowledge claims would qualify as knowledge, leading to a form of skepticism.**, **It is implausible that a theory of knowledge would render most or all typical knowledge claims false by merely shifting contextual standards upwards.**
