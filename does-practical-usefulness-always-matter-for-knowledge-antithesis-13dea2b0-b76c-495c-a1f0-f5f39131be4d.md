## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone knows a mathematical truth, such as 2+2=4, but this knowledge does not have any practical consequences in their life. Intuitively, it seems that the lack of practical consequences does not undermine their knowledge of this mathematical truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition does not require that the belief based on it has practical consequences. This principle together with the claim that practical consequences are necessary for knowledge, entails that there might exist knowledge without practical consequences, challenging the necessity of practical consequences for knowledge.**
