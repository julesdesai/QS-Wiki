## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a justified true belief formed by a reliable process, but their justification is actually accidentally correct, as in classic Gettier cases. Intuitively, we would judge that despite the reliable process and true belief, the person does not possess genuine knowledge.**, **It is plausible that any account of knowledge must rule out Gettier-type situations, where the belief ends up true due to luck, even if reliably formed.**
