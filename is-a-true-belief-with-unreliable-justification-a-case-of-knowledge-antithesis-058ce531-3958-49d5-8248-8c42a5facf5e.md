## Content

**Suppose a person flips a coin and without any other information correctly believes it will land heads. The proposition is true and the belief is held, but the process lacked reliability. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not possess knowledge due to the unreliable justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification for knowledge must not only be true but also reliable. The absence of a reliable justification method indicates the belief does not amount to knowledge.**
