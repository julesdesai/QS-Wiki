## Content

**It is implausible that context-dependent standards can be justified without appealing to another context-dependent standard or previous knowledge, leading to potential circularity.**, **Suppose we attempt to justify a context's standards by referring to another context's approval. Intuitively, this seems like a circular justification with no firm foundation.**
