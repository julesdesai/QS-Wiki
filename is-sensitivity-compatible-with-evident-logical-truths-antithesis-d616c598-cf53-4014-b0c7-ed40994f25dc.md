## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a self-evident logical truth such as a tautology (e.g., if it is raining, then it is raining). In such a scenario, their belief cannot be sensitive because the proposition cannot be false. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the tautology despite the insensitivity.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge of logical truths should not require sensitivity to their truth, given their inherent nature.**
