## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a phenomenon is caused by a specific factor because this factor is generally known to cause such phenomena, and this belief is true and not easily false.**, **Intuitively, we might argue that the person doesn't have knowledge if there are equally plausible competing explanations they haven't considered.**, **It is implausible to claim knowledge of a true and safe belief without proper evaluation of competing explanations, which questions intellectual virtue.**
