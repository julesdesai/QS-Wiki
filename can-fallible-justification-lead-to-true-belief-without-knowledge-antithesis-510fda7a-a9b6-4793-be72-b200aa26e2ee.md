## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a fallible justification that makes the proposition highly likely but not certain. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not truly know the proposition because there is still a possibility of error.**, **A plausible principle is that for a person to know something, there must be no relevant chance of being wrong about it. This principle suggests that knowledge requires a level of certainty that fallible justification cannot provide.**
