## Content

**Suppose a person sees a red apple and forms the belief that there is a red apple in front of them. Intuitively, this seems to be a case of knowledge based solely on perceptual experience, without the necessity of coherence with other beliefs.**, **It is implausible that perceptual beliefs must always cohere with other beliefs or rely on additional foundational beliefs beyond the perceptual experience itself.**
