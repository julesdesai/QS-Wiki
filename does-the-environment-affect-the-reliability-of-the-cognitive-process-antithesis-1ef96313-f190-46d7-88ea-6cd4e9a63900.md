## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a reliable cognitive process to form a belief, but they are in an environment that would typically lead to false beliefs using that process. Intuitively, we would judge that the belief does not amount to knowledge because the environment undermines the reliability.**, **Suppose we have a case in which the surrounding environment plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of a cognitive process. Intuitively, either the process is not reliable due to the environment, or it is, but undermined. If the environment affects reliability, then knowledge based on this process is problematic.**
