## Content

**Suppose a person forms a true belief about an upcoming weather event based on a short-term pattern without considering broader meteorological data. The belief is true in this context, but a change in broader patterns might have resulted in an incorrect prediction, indicating that context affects whether the belief is non-accidentally true.**, **There is a plausible principle that the stability of the truth condition across contexts contributes to knowledge. This principle suggests that variable contextual factors may disrupt the non-accidental truth condition, affecting knowledge status.**
