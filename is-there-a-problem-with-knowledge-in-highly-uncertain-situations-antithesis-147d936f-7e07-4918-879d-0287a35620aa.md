## Content

**Suppose a meteorologist predicts tomorrowâ€™s weather with a high degree of uncertainty but turns out to be correct. Intuitively, she might not know the weather due to the many conditions that could have easily led her to be wrong.**, **In scenarios with high uncertainty, even true beliefs can fail the safety condition due to potential falsehoods nearby.**, **If true beliefs in high-uncertainty scenarios do not count as knowledge because of failure of the safety condition, then knowledge is unattainable in many realistic situations.**
