## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition, then if the proposition were false, they would not believe it.**, **Suppose a case where a person believes a proposition only because they are in a world where it is true, and they would not believe it in worlds where it is false. Intuitively, the principle applies, yet this case is consistent with having true beliefs in nearly all nearby possible worlds.**
