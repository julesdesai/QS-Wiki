**There is a plausible principle that the practical consequences of a belief do not affect its status as knowledge. This principle together with the idea that practical consequences are necessary for knowledge suggests scenarios where knowledge exists without practical consequences.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has a true and justified belief in a mathematical theorem that they never use outside of intellectual pursuit. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that they have knowledge, despite the belief having no practical consequences or usefulness.**
