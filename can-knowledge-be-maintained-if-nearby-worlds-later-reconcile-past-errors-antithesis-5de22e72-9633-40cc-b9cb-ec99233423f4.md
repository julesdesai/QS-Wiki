## Content

**Consider an astronomer who believes a certain theory, which is false but later found to be true through new evidence. Initially, it seems they did not know the theory.**, **If nearby possible worlds later correct for initial errors, it appears inconsistent with the initial lack of knowledge despite true belief.**, **Knowledge seems unstable if it can retrospectively turn a false belief into a true one, undermining the integrity of the safety condition.**
