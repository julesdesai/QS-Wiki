## Content

**Consider a case in which a student, Ethan, has a coherent belief system justifying belief in a scientific theory but is unaware of robust evidence against it, which is intentionally hidden by a mischievous professor. Intuitively, we would judge that Ethan does not know the theory, despite coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherent belief systems can be undermined by hidden or misleading evidence, which points to coherence being insufficient for knowledge.**
