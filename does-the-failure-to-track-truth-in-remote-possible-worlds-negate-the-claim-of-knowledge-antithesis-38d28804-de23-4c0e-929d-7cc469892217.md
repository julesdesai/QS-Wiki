## Content

**Consider a case where a person's belief does not track the truth in a very different possible world. In such a case, intuitively, we would judge that the belief might not be considered knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be overly dependent on conditions only present in distant possible worlds. This principle suggests that a failure in truth-tracking in some remote worlds should not unconditionally negate a claim to knowledge.**
