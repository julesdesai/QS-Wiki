## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition with a high degree of confidence, the proposition is true, and they arrived at this belief through a reliable process. Intuitively, they could be said to know the proposition.**, **Consider that the level of justification required for knowledge is highly context-sensitive, as different contexts demand different levels of evidence and analysis. In some contexts, minimal justification is intuitively sufficient for knowledge.**
