## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition because of a strong personal bias which coincidentally tracks the truth across close possible worlds. Intuitively, we would question whether this constitutes knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be regarded as such if truth-tracking occurs only due to coincidence rather than reliable processes.**
