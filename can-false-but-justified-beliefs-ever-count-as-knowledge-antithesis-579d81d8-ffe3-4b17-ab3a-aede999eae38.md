## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has strong justification for a belief that is false, such as a scientific hypothesis later disproven. Intuitively, we cannot say this constitutes knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth, suggesting that justified beliefs must also be true, contrary to allowing false, justified beliefs as knowledge.**
