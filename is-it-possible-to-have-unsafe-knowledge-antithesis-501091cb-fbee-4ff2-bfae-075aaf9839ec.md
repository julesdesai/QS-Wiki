## Content

**Imagine a case where a person believes a true proposition due to strong evidence available in their current situation, yet in nearly every similar possible situation they would likely have been led into error. Intuitively, we might think the person knows the proposition, despite the belief's lack of safety in nearby possible worlds.**, **A principle suggesting knowledge does not always require the safety condition opposes the necessity of epistemic safety, undermining the view that safety is a necessary condition for knowledge.**
