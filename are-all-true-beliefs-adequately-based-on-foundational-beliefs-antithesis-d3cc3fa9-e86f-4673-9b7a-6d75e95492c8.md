## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition because of a reliable but non-foundational process like expert testimony. Intuitively, we would have to say they have knowledge, which suggests sufficiency does not require foundational beliefs.**, **A principle suggests that if a belief is true and reliably formed, it suffices for knowledge. This undermines the necessity of foundational beliefs for all knowledge.**
