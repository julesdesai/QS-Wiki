## Content

**Suppose an individual forms a true belief through an automatic cognitive process they are unaware of, such as vision or perception, which is generally reliable. Intuitively, we might say the person knows the proposition perceived.**, **The necessity for awareness might discount the role of fundamental cognitive faculties where justification occurs without conscious awareness.**
