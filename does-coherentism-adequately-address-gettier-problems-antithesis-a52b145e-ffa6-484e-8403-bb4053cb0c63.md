## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a true belief that coheres with a set of mutually supportive beliefs, but the truth of the belief is due to an element of luck, as in typical Gettier cases. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge because the belief is true only by coincidence.**
