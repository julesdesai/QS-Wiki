## Content

**Consider a case where a person knows a proposition because of external influences ensuring the truth of their belief, rather than the inherent reliability of the cognitive process. Intuitively, we would judge that the external factor grants knowledge, not the process itself.**, **A principle that knowledge requires internal reliability is challenged when external factors ensure belief accuracy.**
