## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person believes a true proposition based on evidence that, while seemingly convincing in certain contexts, is actually misleading due to extraordinary deceptive circumstances. In such a situation, intuitively, the personâ€™s belief would not constitute knowledge, despite being justified in the context.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth in addition to belief and justification. In light of the principle stating that justification varies with context, justified belief alone cannot account for all situations where knowledge is claimed.**
