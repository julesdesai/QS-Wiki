## Content

**A case in which a personâ€™s belief is the result of a reliable, truth-producing process, yet the person is unable to reconcile the belief with other held beliefs or justify it coherently, suggests that knowledge might require more than mere reliability and truth. Intuitively, coherent integration is integral to knowledge because coherence indicates understanding and rational perspective.**, **The lack of coherence and justification in beliefs, despite their reliability, challenges the adequacy of reliable belief as knowledge, as coherence suggests comprehensive understanding.**
