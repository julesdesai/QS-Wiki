## Content

**Consider the possibility that one might have to continually assess further contexts to confirm if a belief holds. Intuitively, if every context examined leads to a consideration of more contexts, we face an unending process.**, **Suppose the necessity for holding across all relevant contexts implies recursively examining contexts for new potential challenges, suggesting an endless chain of verification.**
