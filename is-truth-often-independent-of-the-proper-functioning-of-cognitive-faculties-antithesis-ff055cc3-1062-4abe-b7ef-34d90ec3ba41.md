## Content

**Assume a situation in which a belief is true independent of the mechanisms or faculties producing the belief, such as obtaining accurate outcomes in chaotic systems.**, **Intuitively, if a true belief arises through unrelated or disjointed faculties interacting by chance, the basis of the truth lies outside strict cognitive functioning.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth in beliefs may sometimes be accidental or incidental to the processes of cognition, challenging alignment with cognitive purpose geared towards truth.**
