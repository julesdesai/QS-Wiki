## Content

**Consider a case where the practical consequences of being wrong affect the evaluation of someone's belief as knowledge. Intuitively, high practical stakes increase the scrutiny of justification needed to claim knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge evaluations should remain consistent irrespective of practical consequences. This principle together with the practical impact on knowledge claims suggests variability in justified knowledge.**
