## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition and that belief comes from a generally reliable process, but their understanding of why the process is reliable is significantly flawed. Intuitively, we must consider whether this flawed understanding undermines their claim to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that having a flawed understanding regarding the reliability of a belief-forming process would not affect one's knowledge status, as knowledge is often thought to require some degree of accurate understanding.**
