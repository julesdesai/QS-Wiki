## Content

**Imagine someone who believes a complex scientific truth correctly without understanding it at all due to institutional trust. Intuitively, we would judge that they believe it but do not know it since they lack direct engagement with the intellectual virtues involved.**, **Knowledge seems to involve some degree of conscious reflection on the reason why a proposition is true. A lack thereof in relying on virtues questions whether the belief counts as knowledge.**
