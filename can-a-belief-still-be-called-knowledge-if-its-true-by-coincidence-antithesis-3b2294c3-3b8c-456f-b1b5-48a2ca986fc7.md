**Consider a situation where a person believes a proposition because they misread information, yet the proposition happens to be true. Intuitively, we might hesitate to call this knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires reliability. This principle suggests that coincidence undermines true belief being knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, as a concept, would permit mere luck or chance in its acquisition.**
