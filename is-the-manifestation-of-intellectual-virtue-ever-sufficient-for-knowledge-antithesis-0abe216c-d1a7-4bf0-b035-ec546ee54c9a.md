## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person named Pat uses their well-developed intellectual virtues to form a belief that is false due to misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that Pat does not have knowledge despite the manifestation of intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that possessing intellectual virtues does not prevent one from forming false beliefs if the evidence is misleading. This means that intellectual virtue is insufficient for knowledge when confronted with deceptive circumstances.**
