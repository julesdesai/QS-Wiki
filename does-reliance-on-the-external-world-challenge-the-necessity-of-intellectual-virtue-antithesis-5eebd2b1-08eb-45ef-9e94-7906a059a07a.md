## Content

**In scenarios where environmental factors play a greater role than intellectual virtues in securing true beliefs, knowledge is still present.**, **For example, a person might know the time by glancing at a clock, yet their belief doesn't stem solely from an intellectual virtue but also from the accuracy of the clock.**, **This implies that external factors, rather than purely intellectual virtues, can be critical for securing knowledge, questioning the necessity condition of the virtue.**
