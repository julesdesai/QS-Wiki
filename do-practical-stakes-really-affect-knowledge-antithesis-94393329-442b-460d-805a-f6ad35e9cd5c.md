## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people, Alex and Jamie, both believe a train will arrive at 5 PM. The train does arrive at 5 PM. Alex has little riding on the train being on time; Jamie, however, stands to win a large sum of money. Intuitively, even though the practical stakes are different, if both have good evidence, they should equally know the train will arrive at 5 PM.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be objective and not dependent on subjective practical stakes. This principle together with the idea that practical stakes affect knowledge implies that knowledge is subjective.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, a fundamentally objective concept, should be influenced by the practical interests of those involved.**
