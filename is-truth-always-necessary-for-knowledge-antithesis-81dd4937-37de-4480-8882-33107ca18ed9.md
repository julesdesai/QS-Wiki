## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a sophisticated AI predicts future events with high accuracy, providing a person with a belief that is correct when shared, but the event changes due to unforeseen circumstances. Intuitively, one might argue the person had predictive knowledge even if the belief did not result in a true proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that emphasizes the predictive power in constituting some form of knowledge. This principle suggests that there may be contexts where truth is not strictly necessary for knowing in the predictive sense, challenging the necessity of truth for knowledge.**
