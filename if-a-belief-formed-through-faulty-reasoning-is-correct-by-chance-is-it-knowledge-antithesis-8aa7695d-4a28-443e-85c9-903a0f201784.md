## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person arrives at a truth through a reasoning process that involves several logical errors. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not possess knowledge because the true belief was acquired through faulty reasoning.**, **There is a plausible principle that distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief by requiring a reliable cognitive process, which implies that chance correctness does not constitute knowledge.**
