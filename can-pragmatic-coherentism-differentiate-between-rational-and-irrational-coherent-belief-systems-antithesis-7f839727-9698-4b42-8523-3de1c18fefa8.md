## Content

**It is implausible that all coherent belief systems leading to practical success are rational given that irrational belief systems may also achieve practical success by coincidence or other factors.**, **Suppose an individual holds irrational yet coherent beliefs that accidentally lead to successful practical engagement. Intuitively, this raises concerns about whether such cases should be classified as instances of knowledge.**
