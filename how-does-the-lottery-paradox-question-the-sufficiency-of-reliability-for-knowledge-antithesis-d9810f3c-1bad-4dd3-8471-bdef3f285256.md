## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes their ticket lost based on a reliable statistical process showing the majority of tickets lose, and it is true that their ticket lost, so the person believes the proposition and the belief is formed by a reliable process. Intuitively, we would have to say that the person does not know their ticket is a losing one despite the reliability involved.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition involves more than just a reliably formed true belief. This principle together with reliable statistical beliefs suggest that reliably informed but probabilistic beliefs do not suffice for knowledge.**
