## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified true belief because of a reliable process, but they have no understanding or awareness of this reliability. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person does not truly have knowledge.**, **A plausible principle states that knowledge requires not just external justification but also some internal awareness or accessibility to the justification. This principle suggests that external conditions alone might not suffice for true knowledge.**
