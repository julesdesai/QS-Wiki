**Consider a scenario where two individuals arrive at the same true proposition: one through logical reasoning and the other through flawed but coincidentally reliable reasoning.**, **Both beliefs meet the safety condition as they could not easily have been false.**, **However, intuitively the distinction in reasoning quality suggests that not both cases constitute knowledge.**
