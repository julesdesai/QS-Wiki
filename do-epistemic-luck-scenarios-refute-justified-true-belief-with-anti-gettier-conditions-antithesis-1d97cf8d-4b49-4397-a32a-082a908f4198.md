## Content

**An example of epistemic luck involves a detective who concludes correctly about a suspect's guilt based on false evidence planted by a third party. The belief ends up true, justified by available evidence, and without involving epistemic luck, yet the true belief is due to luck, indicating a need to rethink the satisfaction of knowledge conditions. Such instances question if even anti-Gettier conditions adequately exclude knowledge incompatible with luck.**
