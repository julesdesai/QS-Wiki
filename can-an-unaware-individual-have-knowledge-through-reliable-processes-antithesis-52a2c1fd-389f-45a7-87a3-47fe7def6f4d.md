## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief through a reliable process while unconscious of the reliability, such as a child accurately reading a clock. Intuitively, we either have to say that the child knows the time or does not. If we say the child does not know, then awareness seems irrelevant to knowledge.**
