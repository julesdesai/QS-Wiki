## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses a generally reliable method to form a belief that is true at the time but later becomes false. Intuitively, we have to say that this changes whether the belief was ever knowledge or that the status of knowledge is unaffected, which seems odd.**, **If we say that the belief was knowledge, then we must accept that knowledge can become false without any change to the original reliability.**
