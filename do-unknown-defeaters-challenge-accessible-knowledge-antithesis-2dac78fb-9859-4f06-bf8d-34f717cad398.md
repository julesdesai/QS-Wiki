## Content

**Consider a person who has a justified, true belief, unaware of any possible defeaters due to limited access to information. Intuitively, it appears that knowledge should be inclusive of those who do not have access to all potential defeaters.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be accessible and inclusive. This principle together with a strict no defeaters condition implies an exclusivity in who can claim knowledge.**
