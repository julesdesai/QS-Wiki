## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be stable over time, yet intellectual virtues can evolve. Changing intellectual virtues challenge the constancy required for stable knowledge.**, **Consider cases where historical shifts in what counts as intellectual virtues alter accepted knowledge. Intuitively, this evolutionary process destabilizes knowledge grounded in such virtues.**
