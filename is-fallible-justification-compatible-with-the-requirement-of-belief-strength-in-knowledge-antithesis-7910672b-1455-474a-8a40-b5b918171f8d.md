## Content

**Suppose a person has a weak belief in a proposition because their justification, though making it likely, is not compelling. Intuitively, one might argue that this weak-belief state fails to qualify as knowledge, which seems to require strong confidence.**, **A principle holds that knowledge entails a robust belief state, which is undermined if justifications are too fallible to inspire full belief.**
