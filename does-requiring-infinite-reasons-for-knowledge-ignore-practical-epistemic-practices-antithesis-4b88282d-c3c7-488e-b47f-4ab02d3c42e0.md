## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist claims knowledge based on empirical evidence and coherent theory, which provides a finite but comprehensive justification. Intuitively, it appears that the scientist possesses knowledge even without infinite reasons.**, **There is a plausible principle that practical epistemic practices operate on finite justifications that are sufficiently robust for knowledge.**
