## Content

**There is a plausible principle that human cognition is limited in its capacity to manage large quantities of information. An infinite series of non-repeating reasons would exceed ordinary cognitive limits, making it implausible that a person could hold and manage such a series to provide justification for even a single belief. Thus, suggesting that human cognition limits preclude the necessary justification for knowledge under the infinitism view.**
