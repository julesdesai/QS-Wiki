## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief based on a chain of reasoning where some premises are false, but the conclusion happens to be true. Intuitively, we either have to say that such false beliefs undermine knowledge or that somehow the outcome redeems the knowledge. If we say false intermediate beliefs undermine knowledge, this challenges the sufficiency of mere causal connections. If we say the true conclusion redeems knowledge, this allows problematic reasoning processes.**
