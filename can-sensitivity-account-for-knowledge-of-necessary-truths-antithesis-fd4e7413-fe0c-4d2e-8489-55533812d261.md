## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows a necessary truth, such as mathematical facts like "2+2=4". Intuitively, we would judge that they know this truth regardless of any hypothetical counterfactual scenario.**, **Knowledge of necessary truths does not depend on sensitivity because these truths cannot be false, and intuitively sensitivity is not required to know something necessarily true.**
