## Content

**In a scenario where someone guesses a true proposition, such as weather predictions without evidence or reasoning, they accidentally satisfy truth conditions.**, **The sensitivity condition dictates the guesser lacks knowledge because they should not have belief if false, yet guessing's vulnerability fits this constraint.**, **One might judge they do not know due to lack of justification within sensitivity.**
