## Content

**Imagine a detective comes to a conclusion about a case considering only half of the available evidence, and coincidentally arrives at the truth without false lemmas. While the detective's belief may be true and justified, intuitively we would judge that due to the incomplete deliberation, this does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should consistently stem from complete and thorough reasoning. Gaps in deliberation suggest an insufficiency in reaching true knowledge.**
