## Content

**Suppose a group of people shares a belief in a proposition, justified by all in their specific relaxed context as knowledge, yet not everyone universally accepts the context's standards. But in another stricter context, some individuals from another group may not find this belief justified. Intuitively, we are forced to conclude that some people share knowledge inadequately.**, **It is plausible that objective knowledge requires universally applicable shared standards and criteria.**, **It is implausible that different standards applied contextually should divide shared knowledge claims so starkly.**
