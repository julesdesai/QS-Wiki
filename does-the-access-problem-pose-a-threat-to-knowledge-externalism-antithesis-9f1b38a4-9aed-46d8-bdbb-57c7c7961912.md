## Content

**It is implausible that a person has knowledge of a proposition if they cannot access reasons or evidence for their belief being reliable. This is because without such access, their belief seems unjustified.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition requires more than the truth and reliability; it requires access to the justifying grounds of the belief to truly constitute knowledge. This challenges the sufficiency of an external reliability account which doesn't require internal access.**
