## Content

**Consider a skeptical scenario where we are all deceived by an evil demon into thinking everything we believe is true. Our intuition is that sensitivity would fail because we would still believe propositions regardless of their truth or falsehood.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires that if a proposition is false, the knower would not believe it. In skeptical cases, this principle is violated as we have no reliable method to determine falsehood.**, **It is implausible that a theory can account for knowledge if it fails to address skeptical challenges, where true belief cannot be distinguished from false belief due to deception.**
