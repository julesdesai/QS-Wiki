## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition but has no reliable method for acquiring the belief. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not possess knowledge.**, **It is implausible that simply believing a true proposition without defeaters always results in knowledge. The implausibility arises because knowledge often requires reliable belief formation, which is absent here.**
