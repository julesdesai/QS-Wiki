## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief through intellectual virtue, but it is only accidentally true. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be accidental. This principle together with accidental truth resulting from intellectual virtue suggests a tension.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is true purely by chance. Intuitively, we either have to say that this is knowledge or that it is not. If we say it is knowledge, then the role of intellectual virtue seems diminished. If we say it is not knowledge, then intellectual virtue may not suffice for knowledge.**
