## Content

**Suppose two people, Bob and Carla, are in different contexts and both claim to know whether a restaurant is open based on different standards.**, **Intuitively, if Bob is in a high-standard context requiring extensive evidence and Carla is in a low-standard context, their knowledge claims could directly conflict.**, **If Bob and Carla disagree about the restaurant's status, contextualism must explain how both can be correct or how this disagreement impacts the truth of their knowledge claims.**
