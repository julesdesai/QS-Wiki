## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which radical skepticism presents doubt about the external world influencing our coherent set of beliefs. Intuitively, we either have to say that coherence leads to unwarranted confidence or that skepticism can undermine coherent justification. If we say coherence leads to unwarranted confidence, we are endorsing potentially false beliefs as knowledge. If skepticism undermines coherent justification, then coherence cannot provide certainty.**
