## Content

**Consider a scenario where different theorists provide diverging criteria for what is contextually foundational. Intuitively, this lack of agreement undermines a stable foundation for defining such justifications.**, **There is a plausible principle that foundational justifications should have clear and stable criteria, a principle challenged by variability in context definition.**
