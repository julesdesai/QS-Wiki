## Content

**Suppose an individual is in a situation where normally reliable senses are deceived, such as being in an expertly constructed optical illusion.**, **Intuitively, even high-reliability sensory processing wouldn't result in knowledge if the belief formed from the senses is systematically deceived.**, **This raises the question of whether reliability under normal conditions is enough for knowledge when abnormal conditions systematically subvert the process.**
