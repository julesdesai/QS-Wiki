## Content

**Suppose someone infers a conclusion from premises that are all sensitive to truth, yet the conclusion is not directly sensitive because it wouldn't be believed if the premises were doubted or unknown. Here, intuitively, the conclusion should still qualify as knowledge if the inference process is reliable.**, **Inferential knowledge lacks direct sensitivity yet seems acceptable under reliable processes, challenging sensitivity as a comprehensive condition for knowing.**
