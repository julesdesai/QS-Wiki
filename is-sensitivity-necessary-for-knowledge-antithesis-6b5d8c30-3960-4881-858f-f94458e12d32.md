## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on strong evidence, yet that belief would remain unchanged even if the proposition were false. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still knows the proposition.**, **If sensitivity requires that a belief would not hold if the proposition were false, then scenarios where beliefs remain unchanged despite their falsity suggest sensitivity is not a necessary condition for knowledge.**
