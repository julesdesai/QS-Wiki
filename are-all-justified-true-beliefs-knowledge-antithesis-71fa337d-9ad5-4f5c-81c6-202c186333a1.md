## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a claim because of a reliable source, which turns out to be true by coincidence, not because of the provided evidence.**, **Suppose another person has a similar belief but based it on faulty reasoning despite the claim being true.**, **Intuitively, these situations suggest that not all justified true beliefs should be considered knowledge due to reliance on coincidental evidence.**
