## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has fallible justification for a true belief but the belief is accidentally true due to a disconnected factor, as in classic Gettier cases. Intuition may suggest the person lacks knowledge because the truth of the belief is not due to the justification.**, **The principle that knowledge requires the justification to be directly responsible for the truth of a belief conflicts with fallible justifications that may lead to Gettier-type problems.**
