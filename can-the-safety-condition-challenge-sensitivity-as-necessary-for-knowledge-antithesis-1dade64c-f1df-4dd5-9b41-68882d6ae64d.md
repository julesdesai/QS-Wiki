## Content

**Suppose a person, Alex, believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence. Intuitively, it seems Alex has knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a person to know a proposition, it must remain true in nearby possible worlds. This principle together with Alex's belief could suggest a case of knowledge without sensitivity.**
