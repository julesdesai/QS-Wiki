## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes it will rain because they read it in a fictional story labeled as news. In this scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge even if the belief coheres with other beliefs about weather patterns.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not just coherence, but also a reliable source. This principle, together with the possibility of a belief cohering despite coming from an unreliable source, entails that coherence is insufficient for knowledge.**
