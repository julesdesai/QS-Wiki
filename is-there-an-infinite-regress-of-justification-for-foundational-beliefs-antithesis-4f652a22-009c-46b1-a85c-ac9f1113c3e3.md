## Content

**There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs must be justified if they are to serve as a basis for other knowledge. This principle suggests that if foundational beliefs require justification, it could lead to an infinite regress, which challenges the claim that foundational beliefs do not require further justification.**, **It is implausible that an infinite regress of justification can exist without undermining the concept of knowledge.**
