## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person reads a horoscope predicting a future event, believes it, and the event occurs exactly as described. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the event will occur because the belief lacks genuine justification**, **It is implausible that simply having a correct belief derived from an unreliable source like a horoscope can constitute knowledge, as it lacks proper justification**
