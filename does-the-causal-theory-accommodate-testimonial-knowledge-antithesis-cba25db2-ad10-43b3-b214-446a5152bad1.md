## Content

**Consider a scenario in which knowledge is acquired through testimony rather than a direct causal link to the fact itself. Intuitively, we might view the transfer of accurate information through trust as a form of knowledge.**, **It is implausible that direct causal connections are necessary for all forms of knowledge acquisition, particularly in social contexts like language and communication. This suggests gaps in sufficiency when causation is emphasized in such contexts.**
