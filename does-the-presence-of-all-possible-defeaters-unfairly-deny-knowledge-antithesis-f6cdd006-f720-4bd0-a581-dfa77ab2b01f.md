## Content

**Consider a case where someone has a justified, true belief with no known defeaters at present, but hypothetically, myriad potential defeaters might exist in some unknown way. Intuitively, it seems unjust to deny knowledge because of speculative possibilities.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be grounded in practical and accessible evidence, not in every possible unknown. This principle together with requiring no defeaters entails an overly restrictive account of knowledge.**
