## Content

**It is plausible that an infinite regression weakens the validity of each justification, as each step is contingent upon the previous stepâ€™s truth. Suppose a person believes a mathematical theorem true supported infinitely by other theorem propositions. But if any one constituent theorem is flawed, this largely undermines the rest of the chain, questioning whether infinite reasons truly buttress the validity of a belief's justification.**
