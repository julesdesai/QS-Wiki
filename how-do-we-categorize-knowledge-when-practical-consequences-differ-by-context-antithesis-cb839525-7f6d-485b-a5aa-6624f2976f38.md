## Content

**Consider a proposition about a rare disease's cure known to a researcher, but regarded as impractical by non-scientists due to context. Intuitively, the researcher knows the cure.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be context-dependent on practical consequences. This principle, together with the requirement for practical use, suggests a discrepancy in knowledge categorization across varying contexts.**, **It is implausible that practical consequence requirements impose context-sensitivity upon what is considered knowledge.**
