## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows proposition A and knows that A entails B, then the person should also know B.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person knows proposition A according to the safety condition but fails the safety check for proposition B which is an entailed proposition.**, **Intuitively, we would have to say either the person fails to know A in the first place or that the safety condition is incompatible with the principle of closure since it denies knowledge of the entailed propositional knowledge.**
