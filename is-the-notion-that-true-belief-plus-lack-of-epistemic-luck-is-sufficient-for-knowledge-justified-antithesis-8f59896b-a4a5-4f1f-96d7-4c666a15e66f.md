## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone, Tim, believes their friend is at a café because they thought they saw them, but were actually mistaken; however, the friend visits the café afterwards coincidentally. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that Tim does not have knowledge despite having a true belief.**, **It is plausible to argue that so long as belief formation involves an error, true belief as a result lacks sufficiency for knowledge even when epistemic luck is ostensibly absent.**, **Asserting that lack of epistemic luck equates to knowledge neglects the role of error in belief formation when determining sufficiency, suggesting insufficiency in defining epistemic luck.**
