## Content

**A plausible principle is that knowledge requires cognitive processes to remain reliable across a wide range of normal conditions. Suppose a person uses a normally reliable cognitive process to navigate but is misled in an unusual magnetic field that disrupts their compass reading. In such a situation, intuitively, we recognize the failure of the cognitive process under atypical conditions, suggesting that knowledge was not achieved even though the process is generally reliable.**, **Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition using a reliable process that fails only in exceptional circumstances, like the compass example above. If the failure under these circumstances leads to a true belief but undermines the broader reliability of the process, it challenges whether such beliefs can constitute knowledge.**
