## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person forms a belief solely based on statistical likelihoods, without false lemmas. Intuitively, while the statistics may be entirely true, the belief may not capture deeper causal relations necessary for knowledge.**, **In a case where belief relies solely on aggregate data without individual facts, there can be a gap between true belief and knowledge due to lack of causal understanding.**, **There is a plausible principle that for belief to be knowledge, it includes a causal narrative or explanation rather than mere statistical support, which is insufficient by itself.**
