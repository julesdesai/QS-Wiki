## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is justified by another belief, which in turn is justified by the initial belief, forming a circularity. Intuitively, such circular justification feels inadequate for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that circular reasoning undermines genuine justification, suggesting that inferential coherentism might permit unacceptable circularity for knowledge claims.**
