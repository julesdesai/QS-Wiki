## Content

**Imagine a scenario in which a generally reliable cognitive process leads to a false belief due to a specific anomalous condition. Intuitively, we do not consider the process reliable in this instance, calling into question its role in defining knowledge.**, **If a reliable process can produce false beliefs without undermining the definition of reliability, then it is unclear how reliability underpins knowledge.**
