## Content

**Consider a belief system where the justification for each belief is another belief within the same system, resulting in a circular justification. Intuitively, circular justification is inadequate for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires non-circular justification. This principle together with circular belief systems challenges coherence-based knowledge.**
