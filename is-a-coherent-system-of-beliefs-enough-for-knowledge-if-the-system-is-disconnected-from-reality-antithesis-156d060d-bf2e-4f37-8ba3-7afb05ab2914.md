## Content

**A coherent system of beliefs can be entirely fictional or imaginative, lacking any connection to actual facts.**, **If a person believes propositions within this coherent but fictional system, and the propositions are true within the fiction, they may still lack knowledge about reality.**, **Thus, a coherent system may fail to account for knowledge if it doesn't involve beliefs related to real-world facts.**
