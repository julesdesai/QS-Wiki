## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Elliot buys a lottery ticket and believes they will lose based on the odds and similar reasoning that applies to each ticket. Intuitively, we would judge that Elliot does not know they will lose despite having justification for the belief, as the belief may still be false due to chance.**
