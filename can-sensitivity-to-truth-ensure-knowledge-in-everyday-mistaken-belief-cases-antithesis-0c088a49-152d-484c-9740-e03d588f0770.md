## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition because of a reliable source's report. The proposition is true, but the source could easily have made a mistake in this specific instance. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the proposition.**, **This scenario undermines the idea that knowledge requires sensitivity because the person's belief would be unchanged even if the proposition were false because of the reliability of the source in other instances.**
