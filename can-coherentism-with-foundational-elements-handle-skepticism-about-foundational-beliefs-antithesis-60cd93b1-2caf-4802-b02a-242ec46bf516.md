## Content

**There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs can still be doubted, especially if they are based on senses or authority susceptible to error. This principle suggests that foundational beliefs require additional justification beyond merely being labeled foundational.**, **It is implausible that labeling beliefs as foundational makes them immune to skepticism, as they might be fallible or misleading, challenging their role in securing knowledge.**
