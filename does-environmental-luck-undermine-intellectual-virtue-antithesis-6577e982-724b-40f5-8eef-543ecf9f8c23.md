**Imagine a situation where a person forms a belief through clear intellectual skill but is in a deceit-laden environment. Intuitively, their belief is at risk of being true by environmental luck.**, **If a person’s belief is true by means unrelated to their intellectual competence due to the deceptive environment, it seems counterintuitive to consider it knowledge.**, **Environmental factors creating luck independently of a person’s intellectual virtues suggest an insufficiency in current conditions for knowledge.**
