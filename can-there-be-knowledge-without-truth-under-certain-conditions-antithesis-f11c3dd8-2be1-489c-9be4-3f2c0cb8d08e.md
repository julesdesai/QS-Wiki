## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a doctor diagnoses a patient based on all available tests and symptoms, believing truly and justifiably that the patient has a specific disease. However, further unseen data would have actually made the diagnosis incorrect. Intuitively, we might still want to say the doctor had knowledge at that time despite the proposition eventually turning false.**
