## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person consistently exercises intellectual virtue, reflecting ideal qualities of an epistemic agent such as careful reflection and open-mindedness, yet the belief formed is accidentally false or not actually held by the person. Intuitively, one might judge that the mere presence of intellectual virtue might not assure knowledge in these cases.**, **There is a plausible principle that possession of intellectual virtue without actual belief and truth cannot be sufficient for knowledge.**
