## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person directly observes a bird and knows it is a cardinal based on visual perception alone, without any inference from other beliefs. It seems reasonable to claim they know the bird is a cardinal, indicating knowledge can be non-inferentially justified.**, **It is implausible that all cases of knowledge require inferential support, as many simple perceptual or memory cases do not involve inference from other beliefs.**
