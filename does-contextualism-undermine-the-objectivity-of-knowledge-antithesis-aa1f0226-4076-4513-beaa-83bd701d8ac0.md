## Content

**There is a plausible principle that objective states of affairs are independent of our subjective contexts. This principle together with the claim that knowledge is objective entails that knowledge should not vary with different contexts.**, **It is implausible that what one person knows can turn into not knowing merely by shifting to a different context without any change in evidence or truth value.**
