## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on evidence processed through implicit biases that they are unaware of, yet the belief is true and they consider themselves justified. Intuitively, these biases might suggest a compromise in virtue-based justification, yet the person still perceives knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that implicit biases can hinder pure virtue-based reasoning, challenging whether unrecognized biases should negate the claim of intellectual virtues being necessary for knowledge.**
