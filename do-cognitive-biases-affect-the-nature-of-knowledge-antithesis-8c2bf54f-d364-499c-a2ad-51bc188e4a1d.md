## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person's belief is true and lacks defeaters, yet the belief results from cognitive biases that distort reasoning.**, **There is a plausible principle that cognitive processes affecting belief formation are relevant to determining whether a belief constitutes knowledge.**, **Intuitively, knowledge cannot reside within beliefs inherently distorted by unchecked biases, regardless of the belief's truth or absence of defeaters.**
