**Consider a scenario in which someone has a reliable belief-forming process about the weather that is accurate 99% of the time. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the weather even if there might be a nearby possible situation where their belief is false.**, **A case in which someone believes it will rain tomorrow based on a meteorologist's forecast is a case where their belief may remain true by good fortune, yet we would intuitively still say they know it will rain.**
