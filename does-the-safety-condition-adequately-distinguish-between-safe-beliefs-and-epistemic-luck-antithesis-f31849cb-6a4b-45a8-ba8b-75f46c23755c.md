## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person survives a lightning strike and believes that the clouds overhead mean rain will follow. In this scenario, although their belief turns out to be true, intuitively, the role of luck seems too significant for it to constitute knowledge.**, **A principle suggesting that excessive dependence on luck undermines the attribution of knowledge creates tension with a safety condition that seems to permit such cases.**
