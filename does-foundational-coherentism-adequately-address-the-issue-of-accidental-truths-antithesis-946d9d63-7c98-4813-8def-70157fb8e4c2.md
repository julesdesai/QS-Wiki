## Content

**Consider a case in which a person believes a complex mathematical truth due to guessing rather than understanding, which happens to cohere with all their axiomatic beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that this belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **Knowledge by chance or accident that happens to align with foundational beliefs remains problematic for theories of justification.**
