## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is derived from a reliable thermometer reading, but the thermometer malfunctions in most nearby possible worlds. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is unsafe because of possible malfunction or that it is knowledge because it was reliably formed in the actual world. If we say it is unsafe, then reliability in the actual world seems insufficient; if we say it is knowledge, then safety in nearby worlds seems superfluous.**
