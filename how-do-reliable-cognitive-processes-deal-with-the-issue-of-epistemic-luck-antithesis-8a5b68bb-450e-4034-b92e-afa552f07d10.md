## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief based on a normally reliable process, but due to unusual circumstances, the belief is true accidentally. Intuitively, we might not consider this belief to constitute knowledge.**, **The presence of epistemic luck suggests that the reliability of the process alone is insufficient to guarantee knowledge.**
