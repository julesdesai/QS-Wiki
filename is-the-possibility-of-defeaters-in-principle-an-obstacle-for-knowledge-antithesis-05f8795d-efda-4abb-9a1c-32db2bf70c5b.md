## Content

**Consider a situation where a person P believes a proposition Q, Q is true, and currently, no known defeaters exist. However, P is aware that future discoveries could reveal a defeater.**, **It seems plausible to argue that the mere possibility of future defeaters raises doubts about P's claim to knowledge.**, **The uncertainty about future defeaters undermines the idea that current absence of defeaters is sufficient for knowledge.**
