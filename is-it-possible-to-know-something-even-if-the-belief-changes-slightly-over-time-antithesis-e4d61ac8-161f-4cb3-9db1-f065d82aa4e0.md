## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person initially holds a belief with slight variations due to growing evidence or understanding, such as learning a complex scientific theory. Intuitively, we generally perceive their knowledge to increase and deepen.**, **It is implausible that necessary small belief adjustments automatically exclude a prior state of understanding from being knowledge, as knowledge is often iterative and evolving over time.**
