## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a reliable cognitive process but their memory, known to be fallible, corrupts the recall of that belief. Intuitively, one may judge that the corrupted belief does not constitute knowledge despite its original reliable formation.**, **The fallibility of memory processes suggests that even beliefs formed by initially reliable processes can lose knowledge status, questioning reliability's sufficiency.**
