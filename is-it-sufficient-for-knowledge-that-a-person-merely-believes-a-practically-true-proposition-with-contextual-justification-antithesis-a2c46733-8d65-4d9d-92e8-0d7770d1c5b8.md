## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone believes a stock will rise because a friend, who they believe to be knowledgeable, told them so. The stock does rise, but only due to an unforeseen and unrelated event. Intuitively, we have to say that the person had a justified belief but did not truly know, as their justification failed to connect to the cause of the truth.**, **It is implausible that contextual justification, when disconnected from the actual causes of a proposition's truth, suffices for knowledge.**
