## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires only internal coherence of beliefs, without needing external coherence with reality.**, **If a person has a perfectly internally coherent set of beliefs, but those beliefs do not match with external reality, it is implausible to say that they have knowledge.**, **A case exists where a person believes they are on Mars and all their beliefs align with this, but they are actually on Earth, illustrating that external coherence is crucial for knowledge.**
