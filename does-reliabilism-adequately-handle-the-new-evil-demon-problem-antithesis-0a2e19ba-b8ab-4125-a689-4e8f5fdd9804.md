## Content

**Consider a person, Alex, who forms beliefs using perceptual processes that are reliable in the actual world but unreliable in a world where a malevolent demon deceives Alex.**, **Even in the deceived world, Alex's beliefs are justified or epistemically responsible from Alex's perspective.**, **Reliabilism implies Alex lacks knowledge in the demon world due to the unreliability of the processes, challenging the view that knowledge should depend on factors beyond subjective access.**
