## Content

**There is a plausible principle that scientific knowledge requires universally applicable justification standards. This principle together with contextualism, which suggests that justification standards vary, entails that knowledge claims in science might not be consistently valid across contexts.**, **If standards for justification can change, allowing for variation by context, then what counts as scientific knowledge in one setting may not in another, which seems incorrect.**
