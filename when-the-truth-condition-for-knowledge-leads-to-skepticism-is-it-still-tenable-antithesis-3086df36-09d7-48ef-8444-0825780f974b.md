## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where contextually coherent beliefs in one context are true but deemed false in another context due to different informational access. It is implausible that such variability can contribute to robust knowledge, as it would entail that knowledge is overly susceptible to skeptical challenges.**, **A principle stating that knowledge requires stable truth across contexts seems to suggest that any dependency on contextual versions of truth undermines the objective nature of knowledge.**
