## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person once formed beliefs reliably, but due to cognitive decline, current beliefs formed even by the same processes are inaccurate. Intuitively, these beliefs do not seem to count as knowledge despite past reliability.**, **For current beliefs to be known, the ability to reliably generate truth must still exist, implying that past reliability is insufficient if the context has significantly changed.**
