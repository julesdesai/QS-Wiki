## Content

**There is a plausible principle that belief formation is sometimes beyond an individual's control, such as cases involving natural disposition or subconscious influences, questioning sensitivityâ€™s applicability.**, **Suppose a person holds a true belief due to an innate predisposition, rather than evidential scrutiny. Intuitively, it seems unclear if they truly know the proposition since the belief is independent of intentional sensitivity.**, **Instances where belief formation bypasses personal control present a challenge to the sensitivity criterion, as knowledge requires more active engagement and assessment than passive belief acquisition.**
