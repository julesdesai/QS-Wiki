## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a true belief due to a lucky guess, such as guessing the outcome of a dice roll correctly. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge about the outcome despite having a true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just true belief about a proposition. This principle together with the scenario of the lucky guess entails that a person can believe a true proposition without having knowledge.**
