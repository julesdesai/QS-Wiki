## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person relies on normally reliable indicators that, by chance, mislead them in most nearby possible worlds. Even if the belief turns out to be true in the actual world, it seems intuitive that they do not know the proposition because the indicators are misleading.**, **A knowledge claim should not rest on indicators that fail under ordinary nearby circumstances. It implies that the safety condition does not suffice for knowledge.**
