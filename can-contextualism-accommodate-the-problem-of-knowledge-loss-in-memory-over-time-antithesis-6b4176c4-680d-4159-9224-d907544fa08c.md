## Content

**Suppose an individual possesses knowledge of a historical fact with solid background evidence. Over time, if such justification fades due to the person forgetting the evidence, we might question whether they still 'know' the fact or merely 'recall' it. The memory of the fact remains true, but justification weakens over time, which intuitively suggests knowledge might not be sustainable.**, **It is implausible to assert that the continuity of knowledge can rely merely on the enduring belief in truth, without maintaining its initial justification, contrasting with typical intuitions about knowing.**
