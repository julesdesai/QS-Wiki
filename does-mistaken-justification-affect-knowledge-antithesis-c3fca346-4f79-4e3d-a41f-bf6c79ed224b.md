## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on faulty reasoning or incorrect justification, like believing it will rain because of a wrong weather prediction but it rains for unrelated reasons. Intuitively, we either have to say that this person knows it will rain or that they do not know. If we say they know, the notion of knowledge is undermined. If we say they do not know, the sufficiency of justified true belief for knowledge is challenged.**
