## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone believes that Smith owns a Ford based on strong evidence, but unbeknownst to them, Smith has just sold the car. Coincidentally, Brown, whom the person also considers, happens to be in Barcelona, making their belief about "either Smith owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona" true. Intuitively, this person does not know the proposition even though their belief is true and would not have easily been false.**, **In such Gettier cases, it is possible for a belief to meet the safety condition without leading to actual knowledge, indicating a limitation in the Safety Condition's sufficiency.**
