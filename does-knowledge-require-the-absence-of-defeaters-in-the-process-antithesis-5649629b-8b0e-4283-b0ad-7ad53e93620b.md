## Content

**Suppose a belief is formed by a reliable process, but there exists a potential defeaterâ€”an element that, if known, would undermine the justification but does not affect the truth. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person has knowledge or that the presence of a defeater implies that they do not. If we say they have knowledge, it suggests that potential defeaters do not matter, which is counterintuitive. If we say the presence of a defeater implies no knowledge, this suggests that awareness or lack thereof impacts knowledge.**
