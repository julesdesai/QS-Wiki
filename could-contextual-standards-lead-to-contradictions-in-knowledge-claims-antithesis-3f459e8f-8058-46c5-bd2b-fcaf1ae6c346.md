## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is considered to know a proposition in their context but is not considered to know the same proposition based on stricter standards applied elsewhere. Intuitively, this scenario could lead to conflicting knowledge claims about the same individual.**, **It is implausible for a coherent theory of knowledge to allow outright contradictions about what a person knows based solely on differing contextual standards.**
