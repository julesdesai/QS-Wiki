**Suppose an investigator has partial but compelling evidence that a suspect is guilty, including a forged confession introduced by mistake, leading to belief in the suspect's guilt.**, **If the suspect is actually guilty despite the forged evidence, intuitively we still judge that the belief does not qualify as knowledge because the decision was based on tainted evidence.**
