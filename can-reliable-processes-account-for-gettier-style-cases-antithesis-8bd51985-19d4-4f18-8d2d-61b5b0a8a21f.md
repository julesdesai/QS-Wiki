## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a clock that indicates the correct time, and they form the belief that it is currently noon based on the clock. Unknown to them, the clock stopped 24 hours ago, but it is sheer coincidence that it correctly indicates the current time. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, even though their belief was produced by a process that is, in this instance, reliable.**, **A case in which a belief is formed by a process that usually produces true beliefs can still result in a true belief through sheer luck, thereby undermining the sufficiency of reliability for knowledge.**
