## Content

**There is a plausible principle that beyond epistemic virtue and true belief, other conditions may be necessary for knowledge, such as safety, where a belief could not easily have been false. This principle suggests that epistemic virtue and truth are not sufficient on their own.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a personâ€™s belief is true and results from epistemic virtue but lies on the brink of error, indicating it is not safe from falsity. Intuitively, this suggests incomplete accounts of knowledge if overlooked.**, **A belief arising from epistemic virtue that could easily have been false challenges the sufficiency claim of possessing knowledge, as knowledge seems to offer an assurance beyond mere truth and virtuous belief.**
