## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's belief in a proposition is justified by incorrect reasoning, yet the proposition happens to be true. Intuitively, we must say that the person does not truly have knowledge, as the truth of the proposition is merely coincidental rather than a result of proper reasoning.**
