## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for a person to know a proposition, their belief should not only not easily be false but must also be based on reliable grounds, which safety alone does not guarantee.**, **Suppose someone believes a true proposition based on an unreliable method, and the belief is not easily false due to coincidental circumstances, intuitively, this does not constitute knowledge.**
