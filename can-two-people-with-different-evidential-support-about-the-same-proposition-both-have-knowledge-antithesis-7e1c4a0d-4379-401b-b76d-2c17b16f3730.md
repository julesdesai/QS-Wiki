## Content

**Suppose two people independently believe the same true proposition, but each has completely different sets of evidence supporting their belief, each unaware of the other's evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that only one or neither has true knowledge, as conflicting evidence cannot both be entirely supportive.**, **It is implausible that knowledge depends solely on isolated evidential support without considering the coherence of all accessible evidence.**
