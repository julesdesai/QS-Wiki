## Content

**Consider a scenario where environmental changes render a previously reliable cognitive process unreliable. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge based on this process is questionable.**, **A process that is affected by environmental changes might reliably produce true beliefs in one setting but not in another. Intuitively, a person's knowledge would then depend on surrounding conditions.**
