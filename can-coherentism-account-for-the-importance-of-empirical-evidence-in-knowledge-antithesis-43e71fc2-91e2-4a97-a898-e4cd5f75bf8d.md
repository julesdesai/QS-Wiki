## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief about a scientific fact coheres with their existing set of beliefs but stands in stark contrast to vast empirical data gathered through scientific observation. Intuitively, we either have to say that empirical evidence is irrelevant to knowledge or that such evidence is central to knowledge. If we say empirical evidence is irrelevant, this conflicts with a common intuition that evidence is crucial to knowledge.**
