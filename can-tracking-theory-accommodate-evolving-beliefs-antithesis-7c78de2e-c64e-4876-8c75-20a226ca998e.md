## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief evolves based on accumulating evidence, initially tracking truth poorly but eventually aligning closely with truth as evidence grows. Intuitively, we may assess the eventual belief as knowledge even when initial steps did not track truth.**, **It is implausible that tracking across possible worlds only at final belief maturity captures the complex, evolving nature of how belief integration works.**
