## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual holds a true belief that causes distress without offering any compensating benefit, such as knowing an unavoidable tragic future event. Intuitively, this true belief seems to lack intrinsic value as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible implication that true beliefs that produce net negative consequences may not possess inherent value. This implication suggests that the value of true belief could depend on its practical effects.**
