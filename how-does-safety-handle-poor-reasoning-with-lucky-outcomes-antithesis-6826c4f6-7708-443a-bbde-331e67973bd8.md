## Content

**Suppose a person guesses the answer on a test without studying and is correct, while in all nearby worlds their guesses would be wrong. Intuitively, we would say the person does not know the answer, despite the safety in the actual world.**, **It is implausible to attribute knowledge when reasoning processes are ignored, suggesting safety needs to account for epistemic processes beyond luck-dependent outcomes.**
