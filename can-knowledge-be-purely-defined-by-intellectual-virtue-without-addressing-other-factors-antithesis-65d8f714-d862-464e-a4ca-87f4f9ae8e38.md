## Content

**Consider a scenario wherein a belief resulting from intellectual virtue also depends on reliable evidence and proper justification. Intuitively, we might suggest that evidence and justification also play a crucial role in the belief being considered knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that just as intellectual virtue is important, justification and evidence are equally significant in constituting knowledge. This together with reliance solely on virtue epistemology without addressing justification raises questions.**, **If intellectual virtue alone is posited as both necessary and sufficient, there exists potential underdetermination regarding how other factors interplay in defining knowledge.**
