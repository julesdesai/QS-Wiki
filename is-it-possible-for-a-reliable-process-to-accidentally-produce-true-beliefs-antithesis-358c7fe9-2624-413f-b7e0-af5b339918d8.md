## Content

**Consider the case of a person who believes that it will rain based on a weather report from an unreliable source, yet it actually rains. The belief is accidentally true but not reliably formed.**, **Intuitively, we would not say that this person knows it will rain despite the belief being true. Thus, reliability seems to require more than just accidental truth.**
