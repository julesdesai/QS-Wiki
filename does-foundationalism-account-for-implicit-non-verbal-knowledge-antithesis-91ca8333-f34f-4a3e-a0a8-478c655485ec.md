## Content

**Consider a child navigating the world successfully without articulated beliefs or verbal knowledge, such as recognizing familial faces. Intuitively, we judge that the child possesses some form of knowledge even without explicit foundational beliefs.**, **The possibility of non-verbal, implicitly understood knowledge challenges the necessity that foundational beliefs need articulation or understanding within an epistemic context, introducing discrepancies in accounting for such knowledge as foundational.**
