## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a flawed but luckily correct process. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the belief could be accidentally true across similar situations without knowledge being present.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person correctly believes it will rain because they heard a false weather report but saw dark clouds. Intuitively, we either have to say that their belief is accidental due to the false report or due to the true visual cue. If we say it is accidental due to the false report, then their belief is accidentally true. If we say it is due to the true visual cue, then luck plays a role in their belief being true across similar situations.**
