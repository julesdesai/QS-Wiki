## Content

**Consider a person using their reliable reasoning to assess a magician's performance as real sorcery rather than trickery due to hidden factors in extraordinary circumstances. Intuitively, reliable cognitive processes may lead to incorrect conclusions in such contexts, challenging the sufficiency of reliability for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that reliability alone suffices for knowledge without considering extraordinary factors that can twist outcomes beyond reliable confines.**
