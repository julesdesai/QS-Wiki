**Consider two individuals with coherent belief systems that are mutually inconsistent. Intuitively, if coherence were sufficient for knowledge, both individuals could claim knowledge of contradictory propositions.**, **It is implausible that coherence alone can ensure true knowledge if two coherent systems can lead to contradictory truths.**
