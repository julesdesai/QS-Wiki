## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a belief that is true but acquired through rote memorization or random guessing rather than intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that they do not know it due to the lack of intellectual virtue. If we say the person knows the proposition, then it conflicts with the necessity of intellectual virtue. If we say they do not know it, then we contradict intuitive judgments that favor knowledge in some rote memorization cases.**
