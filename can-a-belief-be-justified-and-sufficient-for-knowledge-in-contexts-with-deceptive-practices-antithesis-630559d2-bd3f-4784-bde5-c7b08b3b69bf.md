## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone buys a product believing it is ethically made because of the manufacturer's marketing claims. Later, it is shown that these claims were false, though the purchaser had no way to verify this at the time. Intuitively, we would judge that the person did not know the product was ethically made.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge cannot rest on beliefs formed within systematically misleading environments. This principle challenges the sufficiency of believing a practically true proposition with contextually determined justification for knowledge.**
