## Content

**Consider a scenario where an initially reliable cognitive process yields a false belief due to unforeseen circumstances, questioning whether such a process should be classified as unreliable.**, **If a cognitive process can fail in rare instances, resulting in false beliefs, yet still follows the criteria of reliability for knowledge, it challenges the sufficiency and necessity of this requirement.**
