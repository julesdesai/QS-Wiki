## Content

**Consider a Gettier-style scenario where a justified true belief is formed through a reliable process but includes an element of luck. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the belief lacks knowledge despite satisfying typical justification.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person sees a lifelike cardboard cutout of a barn but correctly identifies a real barn behind it. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is safe due to the real barn, which seems false, or it is not safe, which suggests failure in the safety condition.**
