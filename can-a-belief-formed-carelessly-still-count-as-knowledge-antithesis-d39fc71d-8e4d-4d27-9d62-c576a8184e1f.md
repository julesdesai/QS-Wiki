## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Sarah, forms a belief that it will rain tomorrow because she wants it to rain, not because of any evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that Sarah does not know it will rain tomorrow.** 
**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is true and believed, yet the belief results from a careless judgment rather than intellectual virtue. In such a case, it is implausible that this belief constitutes knowledge.**
**A plausible principle is that for knowledge, a belief must be achieved through reliable and careful thinking. This principle suggests that beliefs formed carelessly or whimsically cannot be knowledge, even if true.**
