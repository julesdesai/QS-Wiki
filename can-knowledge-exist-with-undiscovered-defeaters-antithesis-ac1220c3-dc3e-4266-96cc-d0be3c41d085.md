## Content

**A case in which some person P believes a proposition Q, Q is true, and P has justification for Q but is unaware of any defeaters that exist against Q is a case in which P does not have knowledge of Q.**, **In such a scenario, an undiscovered defeater still undermines the justification even if it is unknown to P.**, **The fact that P is unaware of the defeater suggests that mere absence of awareness does not suffice for knowledge.**
