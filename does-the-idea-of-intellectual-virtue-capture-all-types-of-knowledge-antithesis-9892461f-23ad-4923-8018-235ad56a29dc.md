**Consider a scenario in which an ancient astronomer believes the Earth orbits the Sun due to careful observations and reasoning that we now know are incorrect. Intuitively, we would judge that the astronomer had knowledge at the time, despite the incorrect reasoning not being considered an intellectual virtue today.**, **There is a plausible principle that scientific knowledge can change over time without faulting past knowledge holders. This principle suggests past beliefs can be known despite not always aligning with current standards of intellectual virtue.**
