**Suppose we are in a skeptical scenario where an evil demon creates comprehensive false experiences for a believer, yet in numerous nearby possible worlds, such a demon also deceives in the same or similar fashion.**, **In such scenarios, the personâ€™s erroneous belief would seem safe under the safety condition because its truth would hold in those demon-deceived worlds.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly possess knowledge in this skeptical scenario, indicating a flaw in the sufficiency clauses of the safety condition.**
