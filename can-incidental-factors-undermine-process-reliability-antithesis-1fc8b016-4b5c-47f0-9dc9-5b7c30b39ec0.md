## Content

**A reliable process can be undermined by accidental or incidental changes that do not reflect its general reliability, affecting whether the output is knowledge.**, **Consider a reliable weather prediction model temporarily compromised by a hack that does not affect its general reliability. A correct forecast during the hack intuitively seems less like knowledge due to incidental factors influencing the process.**
