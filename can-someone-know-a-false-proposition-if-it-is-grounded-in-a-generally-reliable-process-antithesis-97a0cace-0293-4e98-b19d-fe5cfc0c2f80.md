## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses a usually accurate weather app and believes it will rain, but it does not rain due to an unexpected weather shift. Intuitively, we might think their belief cannot be knowledge because the proposition is false.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be constituted by false propositions even if grounded in a generally reliable belief-forming process.**
