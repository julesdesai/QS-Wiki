## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not necessarily require belief, as some cases suggest that a person might act on, assert, or even be guided by a true proposition without consciously forming a belief.**, **In certain cases, like implicit knowledge or habitual knowledge, people behave in a way that indicates knowledge without actively holding a belief, suggesting that belief may not be strictly necessary for knowledge.**
