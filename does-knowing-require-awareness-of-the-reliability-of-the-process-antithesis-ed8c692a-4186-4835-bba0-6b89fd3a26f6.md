## Content

**Suppose a person uses a method they believe to be unreliable but is actually highly reliable, such as using an unintentionally accurate method for navigation.**, **Intuitively, if the person doesn't recognize the reliability and doubts the method, their belief may not count as knowledge.**, **The implication is that merely having a reliable process isn't enough without the subject's awareness or endorsement of the process's reliability.**
