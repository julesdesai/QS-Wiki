## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a chain of reasons extends infinitely without repetition. Intuitively, constructing such a chain appears highly unlikely.**, **Suppose we claim a chain can be infinite and non-repeating, then it becomes challenging to identify any real-world practice that approximates this model.**, **It is implausible that human reasoning, bound by finite language and cognitive limits, can ever manifest an infinite, non-repeating justification sequence.**
