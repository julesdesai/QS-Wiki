## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a mathematical theorem based solely on a vague memory of a past lecture. The theorem is mathematically true, but the person lacks certainty about why it is true. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know the theorem.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires at least some degree of understanding and certainty about why something is true. This principle, together with the notion that true belief minus certainty suffices for knowledge, entails that the person inaccurately described as knowing the theorem despite their lack of understanding.**
