## Content

**In a scenario of cultural divergence where justification norms differ significantly, two individuals may hold contradictory beliefs yet be justified according to their own contexts. Intuitively, this seems problematic for knowing the same proposition across different contexts.**, **The plausibility of a principle that justification should lead to consensus is threatened by divergent context-relative extensions, suggesting issues with reliable inter-context knowledge.**
