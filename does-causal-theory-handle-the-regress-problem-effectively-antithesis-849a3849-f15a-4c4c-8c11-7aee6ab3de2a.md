## Content

**Consider the regress problem in epistemology, where justifications cascade endlessly. A causal requirement can contribute to an endless regress of causal explanations. Intuitively, unresolved regress poses difficulties for the causal account of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that solutions to the regress problem should offer closure to knowledge chains. Endless causal regress challenges assumptions regarding the causal theory's sufficiency and completeness.**
