## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief based on a causal chain that includes an accidental factor leading to the true belief. Intuitively, we judge that such a belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot result from accidental causes. This principle suggests that the presence of accidental factors in the causal chain undermines the claim to knowledge.**
