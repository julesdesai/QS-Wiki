## Content

**Consider a scenario in which one's perceptual belief is central to their overall coherent belief system, but the perceptual experience turns out to be a hallucination. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person's belief does not constitute knowledge, even if it is coherent with their other beliefs.**
