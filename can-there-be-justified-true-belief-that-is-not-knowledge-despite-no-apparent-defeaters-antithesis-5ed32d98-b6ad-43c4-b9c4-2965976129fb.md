## Content

**Suppose someone has a justified belief that their clock accurately shows the time and thus believes it is noon, which is true. Intuitively, they do not know it is noon if the clock is broken and just happens to show the correct time.**, **In this scenario, there appear to be no defeaters since they have justification and the belief is true, yet the intuition suggests the person lacks knowledge.**
