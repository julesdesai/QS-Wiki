## Content

**Suppose a process reliably produces a majority of true beliefs but yields a false belief in a particular case. Intuitively, having false beliefs challenges the view that the process unconditionally fosters knowledge.**, **A process is considered reliable if it generally produces true beliefs, but instances of false beliefs suggest that reliability is not solely sufficient for knowledge.**
