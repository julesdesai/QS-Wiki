## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a detective forms a belief about a suspect's guilt via insight and experience, standardly considered intellectual virtues. However, let's say the detective's belief is true due to an unrelated confession from the suspect's accomplice. Intuitively, we would conclude the detective lacks knowledge because the belief's truth did not result solely from the virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge entails understanding the relation between the belief and its truth. If this principle holds, intellectual virtue alone cannot suffice to establish knowledge.**
