## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a true belief resulting from a reliable method unrelated to the fact that makes the proposition true. In such a case, intuitively we might still consider the person to have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a belief is formed through systematic and reliable means, it can still qualify as knowledge. This principle together with the scenario suggests that a causal connection might not be a necessary component for knowledge.**
