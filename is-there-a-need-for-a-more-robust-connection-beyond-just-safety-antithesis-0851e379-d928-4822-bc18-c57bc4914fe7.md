## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone believes a true proposition but without understanding the reasons why it is true. Intuitively, knowledge involves an engaging with the reasons behind truth, not just satisfaction of the safety condition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing involves understanding why a proposition is true and not just that it remains true in nearby possible worlds.**
