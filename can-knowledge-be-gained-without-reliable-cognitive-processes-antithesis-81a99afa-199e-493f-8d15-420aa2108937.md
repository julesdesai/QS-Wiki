**Consider a scenario where a person accidentally acquires a true belief without using a reliable cognitive process, such as intuition or luck alone.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, we might still judge that the person has knowledge because the belief is true and believed.**, **It is implausible to say that knowledge must always come from reliable cognitive processes if true beliefs can arise from unreliable methods.**
