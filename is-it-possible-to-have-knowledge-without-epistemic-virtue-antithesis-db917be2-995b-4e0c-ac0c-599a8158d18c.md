## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition due to an external influence, such as coercion or persuasion, rather than their own epistemic virtue. Intuitively, this person has a true belief, but not knowledge because the belief does not arise from their own epistemic virtue.**, **Consider a scenario where external sources rather than personal epistemic virtues yield a true belief. Intuitively, this reliance on external sources contradicts the idea of knowledge requiring one's own epistemic virtue.**, **A belief that is true but influenced by factors outside one's epistemic virtues, such as luck or manipulation, does not satisfy the intuition necessary for it to be termed knowledge.**
