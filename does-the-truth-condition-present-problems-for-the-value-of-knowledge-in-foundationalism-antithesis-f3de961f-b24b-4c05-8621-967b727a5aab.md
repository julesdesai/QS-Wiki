## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the value of knowledge is inherently greater than mere true belief. This principle together with the claim that knowledge requires truth suggests that knowledge should offer added value over mere accidental truth.**, **Suppose we have a case in which someone arrives at a true belief purely by coincidence, such as predicting a sports outcome via flipping a coin. Intuitively, this does not constitute knowledge given its lack of substance beyond being luckily true, highlighting the inadequacy of leveraging truth alone in defining knowledge.**
