## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief through a reliable process purely by luck, such as guessing the outcome of a coin toss. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not actually have knowledge, even though the belief was true and formed through a seemingly reliable process.**, **A plausible principle suggests that knowledge requires more than mere true belief derived from a reliable source, such as possessing justification or evidence. This principle entails that the reliability of the process alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
