## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a particular proposition and coincidentally the proposition turns out to be true due to random chance. In such a scenario, intuitively we consider the person does not have knowledge because the truth of the belief and the belief itself are not connected in a way that is relevant to knowledge.**
