## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition due to a faulty inference from other beliefs, yet the proposition is true accidentally. Intuitively, the belief doesnâ€™t seem to qualify as knowledge despite coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that accidental truths, even though coherent within a belief system, should not be considered knowledge. This suggests weakness in assessing inferentialist coherentism.**
