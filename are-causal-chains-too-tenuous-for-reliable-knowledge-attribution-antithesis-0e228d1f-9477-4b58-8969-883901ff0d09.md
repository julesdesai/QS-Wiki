# Are causal chains too tenuous for reliable knowledge attribution?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 0e228d1f-9477-4b58-8969-883901ff0d09

## Content

**It is implausible that all knowledge claims can be reduced to reliable causal links. Consider a scenario where historical documentation and transmission processes introduce significant noise yet still provide a valid historical account. Intuitively, we would judge that despite tenuous causal chains, historical knowledge remains valid.**
