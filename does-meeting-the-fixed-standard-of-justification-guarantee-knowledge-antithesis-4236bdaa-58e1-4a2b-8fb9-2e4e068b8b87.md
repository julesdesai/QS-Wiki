## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person P has a true belief about the stock market based on insider trading information that fulfills the fixed standard of justification. Intuitively, we would judge that such a belief does not constitute knowledge due to its unethical source.**, **A belief based on dubious ethical grounds, even if justified and true, does not intuitively count as knowledge.**, **For knowledge, the manner in which justification is achieved may play a crucial role, beyond just meeting a fixed standard.**
