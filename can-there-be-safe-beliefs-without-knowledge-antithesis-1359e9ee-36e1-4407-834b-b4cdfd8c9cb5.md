## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person flips a coin and believes it will land heads because they have always seen it land heads before, and it happens to land heads. In this scenario, their belief could not easily have been false, yet we intuitively feel they lack knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just safe belief and truth, which entails that safe belief and truth alone are not sufficient for knowledge.**
