## Content

**Consider a scenario in which what constitutes an intellectual virtue in one context may not be viewed as such in another due to cultural or societal variations. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge knowledge as context-sensitive, potentially undermining uniform applicability of intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible that belief formation through intellectual virtue acts as a consistent standard across diverse contexts without accounting for varying interpretations and applications of virtue.**
