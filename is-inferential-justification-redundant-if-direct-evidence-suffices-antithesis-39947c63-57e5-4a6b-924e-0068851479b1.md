## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a historian directly examines primary source documents that unequivocally support a particular historical claim. Intuitively, we would see the historian's belief as justified without the need for further inference.**, **There is a plausible principle that direct evidence can provide adequate justification for belief without additional inferential processes. This principle together with primary source evidence directly supporting a claim entails the potential redundancy of inferential justification in such cases.**
