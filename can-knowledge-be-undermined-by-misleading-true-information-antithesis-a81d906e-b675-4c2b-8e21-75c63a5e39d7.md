## Content

**Imagine a case where a person believes a true proposition based on a misleading supporting fact, causally connected to the truth but not sufficient on its own, such as misrepresentative evidence. It seems counterintuitive to count this as knowledge.**, **Suppose the belief is formed by understanding a fact that accurately supports numerous false propositions, along with one true proposition. Here, the causal connection undermines knowledge intuition.**
