## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a belief is correct in some contexts but the same belief would be easily falsified in many slightly altered contexts.**, **Intuitively, we either have to say that knowledge is absent due to potential errors, or that potential errors don't necessarily undermine knowledge. If we say potential errors matter, safety is a fragile ground for knowledge.**
