## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, justification must involve a universal standard and additional context-relative elements constrained by broad evidence coherence**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and they meet both universal and constrained context-relative justification**
