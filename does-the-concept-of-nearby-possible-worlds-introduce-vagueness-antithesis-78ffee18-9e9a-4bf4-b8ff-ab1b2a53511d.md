# Does the concept of "nearby possible worlds" introduce vagueness?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 78ffee18-9e9a-4bf4-b8ff-ab1b2a53511d

**Terminal:** No

## Content

**Consider a scenario in which the criteria for what counts as a nearby possible world are vague, leading to ambiguity in whether a belief is safe. Intuitively, we would judge that ambiguity should not affect our knowledge attributions.**, **It is implausible that knowledge depends on vaguely defined parameters, which suggests that safety conditions that rely on them can be problematic.**
