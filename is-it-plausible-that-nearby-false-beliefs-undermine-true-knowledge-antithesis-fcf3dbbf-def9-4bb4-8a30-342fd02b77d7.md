## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a true belief, but slight alterations in circumstances in nearby possible worlds lead to false beliefs. Intuitively, this proximity to false beliefs undermines the notion of knowledge being secure or robust.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should not be undermined by close possibilities of error in nearby possible worlds, suggesting this is essential for understanding the nature of knowledge.**
