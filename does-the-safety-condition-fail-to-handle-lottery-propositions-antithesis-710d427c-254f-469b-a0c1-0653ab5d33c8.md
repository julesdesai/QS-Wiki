## Content

**Consider a lottery with a million tickets and one guaranteed winner. A person forms the belief that their ticket will lose before the draw. Intuitively, this person does not know their ticket will lose despite the high probability of truth in nearby worlds.**, **In nearly all nearby possible worlds, the person's belief that their ticket will lose is true, given the large number of tickets. It is implausible that this high probability meets the safety requirement for knowledge.**
