## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes that a lottery ticket is a losing ticket based on statistical reasoning and it indeed turns out to be a losing ticket. The belief is true and it is safe because, in most similar situations, the ticket would indeed be a losing ticket.**, **Intuitively, we might feel that the person doesn't really know the ticket is a losing one because its correctness was due to epistemic luck despite it being true and safe.**, **It is implausible to regard beliefs influenced heavily by luck as knowledge, even if they meet other criteria like truth and safety.**
