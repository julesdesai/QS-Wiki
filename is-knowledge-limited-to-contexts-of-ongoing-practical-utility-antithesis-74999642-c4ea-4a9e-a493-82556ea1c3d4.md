## Content

**It is implausible that knowledge must always be tied to contexts of ongoing practical utility. Some knowledge may concern truths about distant or impractical entities or concepts.**, **Consider the knowledge of extinct species or distant galaxies which does not affect daily decisions. Intuitively, knowing these truths forms a kind of knowledge irrespective of their practical utility.**
