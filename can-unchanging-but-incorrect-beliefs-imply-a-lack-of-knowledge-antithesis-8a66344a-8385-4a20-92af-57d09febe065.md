## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual locks in a belief that is incorrect yet unchangeable. Intuitively, we either have to say that this implies knowledge due to stability or a lack of knowledge due to falsity. If we accept stability implies knowledge, it conflicts with the requirement for truth. If we say the falsehood implies lack of knowledge, it challenges stable beliefs alone as a measure of knowledge.**
