## Content

**Suppose a scenario where a personâ€™s belief coheres with a system of beliefs that includes an anti-skeptical guarantee; however, the core assumptions of the system are flawed; intuitively the belief could be false.**, **There is a plausible principle that belief coherence does not ensure truth if the anti-skeptical guarantees are based on incorrect foundations.**
