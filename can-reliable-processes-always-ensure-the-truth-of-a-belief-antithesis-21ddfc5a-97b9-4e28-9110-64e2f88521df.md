## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person uses a usually reliable weather app to check the weather and believes it will not rain. However, unknown to them, the app is experiencing a rare bug and the forecast is incorrect. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the weather.**, **It is plausible to think that for a belief to qualify as knowledge, it must not only result from a reliable process but also be true in a specific instance rather than in a general sense.**
