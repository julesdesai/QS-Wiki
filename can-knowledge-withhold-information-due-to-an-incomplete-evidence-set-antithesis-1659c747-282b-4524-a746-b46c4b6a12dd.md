## Content

**Consider a case in which a scientist concludes that a new drug is safe based on the trials conducted, which are all in favor of safety. Unbeknownst to the scientist, there are undiscovered side effects in a subpopulation not included in the trial. The belief is unqualifiedly justified and true, yet intuitively, the scientist lacks knowledge about the drug's overall safety.**
