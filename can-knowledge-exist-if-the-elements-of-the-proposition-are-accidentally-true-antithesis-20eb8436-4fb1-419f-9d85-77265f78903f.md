## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual has a true belief about a future event that occurs due to unforeseen circumstances. Intuitively, we might judge that the person lacks knowledge because the truth of the proposition was achieved accidentally.**, **It is plausible to assert that knowledge excludes outcomes resulting from epistemic luck. If the elements of the proposition are accidentally true, then it threatens the exclusion of epistemic luck.**
