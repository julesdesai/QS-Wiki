## Content

**There is a case where a person trusts a source about a specific scientific fact without understanding why the fact is true. Intuitively, we would judge that while the person might hold a true belief, they do not have justification in the epistemic sense necessary for knowledge if they lack understanding.**, **Knowledge is often associated not only with true belief and trust but also with having the right kind of justification, which trust alone may not provide.**
