## Content

**Consider a scenario where social context and external factors heavily influence the formation of a supposed basic belief. Intuitively, the reliance on context suggests that such beliefs may not be foundationally self-supporting.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should account for external influences on belief formation. This principle together with the idea of basic beliefs lacking such an account questions their sufficiency for knowledge.**
