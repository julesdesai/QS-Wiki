## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition because they have reliable evidence, but their belief is not sensitive because they would still believe it if it were false. Intuitively, we might judge that this person has knowledge, even though their belief does not satisfy the sensitivity condition.**, **The sensitivity condition requires that a person would not hold a belief if the belief were false, but there are cases where reliable evidence leads one to have knowledge despite potential counterfactual belief in the falsehood of the proposition.**
