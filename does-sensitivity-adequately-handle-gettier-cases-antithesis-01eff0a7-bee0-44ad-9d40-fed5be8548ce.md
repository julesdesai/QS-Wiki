## Content

**A person believes a true proposition based on justified belief (e.g., “Smith owns a Ford”), but due to misleading reasoning involving irrelevant aspects that strangely coincide with truth.**, **Under sensitivity, if the proposition was false, they wouldn't hold belief; however, their current belief remains irrespective of reliance on true yet misleading scenarios.**, **Intuitively, due to luck in obtaining belief without bona fide path to truth, they lack genuine knowledge despite sensitivity tests passing.**
