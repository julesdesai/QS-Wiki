## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition due solely to properly functioning cognitive faculties without any justification for the belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, as justification is conventionally seen as integral to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that cognitive functioning alone negates the traditional necessity of justification for knowledge, creating a tension with the sufficiency claim.**
