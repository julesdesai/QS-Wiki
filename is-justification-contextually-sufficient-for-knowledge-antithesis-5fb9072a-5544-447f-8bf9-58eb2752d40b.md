## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone in a context requires minimal evidence to justify their belief, while another context requires exhaustive evidence for the same proposition. Intuitively, these variations in what suffices for justification undermine the sufficiency of context-determined justification for knowing.** **It is implausible that the mere context of justification always suffices for knowledge since it may allow for too much variability in knowledge claims.**
