## Content

**Consider a case where John is a skilled meteorologist who analyzes all weather data and concludes it will rain but doesn't personally hold the belief that it will rain due to superstition.**, **In such a case, intuitively we would judge that John knows it will rain, even though he does not believe it will rain.**, **This suggests that there might be situations where belief is not strictly necessary for knowledge.**
