## Content

**It is plausible that a belief produced by a reliable process might not be justified if the reason for the reliability is unknown to the believer, such as a person stumbling upon a truth by sheer luck.**, **Consider a scenario where someone correctly guesses an answer on a test due to an inexplicable instinct that usually proves accurate, yet they have no justification for the answer. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the test answer, even though the belief was correct and produced by a reliable process.**
