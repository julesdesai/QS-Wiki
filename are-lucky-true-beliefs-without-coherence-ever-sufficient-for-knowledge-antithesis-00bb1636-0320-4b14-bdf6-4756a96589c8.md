## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person randomly picks the correct lottery numbers, forming a belief they will win based purely on a whim. Although the belief is true, it seems intuitive that the person does not have knowledge of their win.**, **A belief that turns out to be true purely due to luck is often considered epistemically deficient irrespective of its coherence with other beliefs.**, **A true belief that results from luck lacks the justifying coherence that typically characterizes knowledge.**
