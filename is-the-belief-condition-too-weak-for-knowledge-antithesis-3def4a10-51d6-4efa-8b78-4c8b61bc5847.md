## Content

**Suppose there is a case in which a person sincerely claims to believe a true proposition but lacks adequate conviction or emotional investment in it. Intuitively, we might argue that such a belief is too weak to count as knowledge.**, **It is implausible that mere belief, regardless of its strength or conviction in truth, is enough for knowledge because true knowledge seems to require a deeper commitment to the proposition's truth.**
