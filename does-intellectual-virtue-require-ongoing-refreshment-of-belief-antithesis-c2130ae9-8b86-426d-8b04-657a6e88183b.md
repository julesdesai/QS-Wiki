## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief using intellectual virtue ten years ago, but has not reconsidered new evidence since. Intuitively, we would question whether their belief still constitutes knowledge today.**
**Suppose we have a case in which a belief grows outdated without reconsideration of newer evidence, challenging the notion that virtue at a single moment is sufficient for enduring knowledge.**
**It is implausible that a static belief formed with virtue long ago remains knowledge in changing contexts without any reactive reassessment.**
