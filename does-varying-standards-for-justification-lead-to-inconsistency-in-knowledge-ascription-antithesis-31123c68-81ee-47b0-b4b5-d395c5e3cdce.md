## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person asserts that they know a proposition in a casual context with low standards for justification. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the proposition.**, **Consider a scenario in which the same person attempts to assert the same proposition in a scientific context with high standards for justification. Intuitively, it seems that the person no longer knows the proposition.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should be consistent regardless of context changes for the same proposition and justification. This principle together with variable contextual standards entails that knowledge can become inconsistent across contexts.**, **It is implausible that a person knows a proposition at one moment but not another solely due to changes in conversational context.**
