## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified belief that is true by coincidence, such as being correct about the time because their stopped watch happened to match the actual time. Intuitively, we would judge that this person lacks knowledge because their justified belief is only accidentally true.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires not just justified true belief, but also an element that rules out the possibility of mere coincidence causing the truth of the belief. This principle suggests that justification alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
