## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual forms a belief based on a cognitive process that is reliable only to a certain degree, say 70% of the time. Intuitively, we may judge that knowledge requires not just reliability but a higher threshold or certainty.**, **The principles of reliability suggest that partial or probabilistic reliability might not suffice for claiming complete knowledge of a proposition.**
