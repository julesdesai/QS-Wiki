## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is often considered necessary that there are no nearby worlds where they would believe falsely if they believed at all. This suggests that simply having a true belief that is not false in nearby worlds is insufficient for knowledge.**, **A counterexample arises if a person forms a belief in a true proposition only because they momentarily looked at a functioning clock, which is broken in most nearby possible worlds. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge.**
