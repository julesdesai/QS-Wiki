## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's belief about a true proposition cannot easily be false because the person is unknowingly fed true information by a benevolent source. Intuitively, we might say the person does not possess genuine knowledge because their belief lacks personal justification.**, **It is implausible that lack of personal justification allows status as knowledge, even if the belief itself could not easily have been false.**
