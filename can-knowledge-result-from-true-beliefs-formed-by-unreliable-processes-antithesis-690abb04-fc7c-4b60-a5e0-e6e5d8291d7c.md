## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition due to a very unreliable method, and the proposition turns out to be true purely by chance. Intuitively, this does not seem to be a case of knowledge.**, **A person can form a true belief by flipping a coin to decide what to believe about a proposition, but this belief lacks justification or reliability.**
