## Content

**Suppose a beliefâ€™s truth relies on fragile circumstances or coincidental factors. If these fragile elements do not typically enter into what we count as knowledge, then the safety condition alone appears insufficient.**, **There are plausible cases where a belief meeting the safety condition involves factors that do not align with our intuitions about what grants knowledge.**
