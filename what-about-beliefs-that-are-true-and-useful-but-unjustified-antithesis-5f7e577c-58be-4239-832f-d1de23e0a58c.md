## Content

**Consider a person who randomly guesses the correct answer on a test and this guess holds practical value. Intuitively, we might resist labeling this as knowledge without justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge involves justified true belief, which challenges the sufficiency of practical consequences alone in categorizing true beliefs as knowledge.**
