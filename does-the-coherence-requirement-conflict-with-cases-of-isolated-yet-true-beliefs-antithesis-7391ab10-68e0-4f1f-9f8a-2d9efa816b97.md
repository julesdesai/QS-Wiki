## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition derived in isolation from other beliefs. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is not knowledge due to lacking coherence or that coherence is not truly necessary.**, **A case in which a belief about an obscure fact is true but stands alone further complicates the coherence necessity. Intuitively, lacking interconnected knowledge suggests incompleteness.**
