## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition and has strong justification for it, like deducing a mathematical fact. Intuitively, we might regard this as knowledge even if no practical consequence follows from it.**, **It is implausible to require practical usefulness for knowledge, since many academic pursuits providing crucial knowledge may not have immediate practical applications.**
