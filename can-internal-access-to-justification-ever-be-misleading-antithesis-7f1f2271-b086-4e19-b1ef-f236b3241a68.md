## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has introspective access to their reasons for a belief which are actually based on a false premise. Intuitively, we would judge that despite their access to justification, the person does not have true knowledge.**, **It is plausible that one can have introspective access to justification for a belief without it guaranteeing the accuracy or truth of that belief. This can occur if the introspectively accessed justification is built on incorrect information.**
