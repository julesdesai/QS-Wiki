## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for knowledge to be reliably identified, the conditions for knowing must be clearly discernible. The notion of the exercise of intellectual virtue lacks precision in many instances.**, **Suppose we have an ambiguity in what constitutes an exercise of intellectual virtue, leading to potential disagreements in judgements about whether one knows. It is implausible that such a vague requirement can adequately ground the concept of knowledge.**
