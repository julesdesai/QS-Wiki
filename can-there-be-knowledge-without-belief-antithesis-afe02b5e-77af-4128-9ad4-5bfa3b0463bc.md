## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person correctly attains a true conclusion purely by non-conscious processes, such as intuition or gut-feeling, without forming a belief about the proposition. Intuitively, it seems plausible to say the person knows the proposition despite not holding a belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not always require belief as a conscious commitment. This principle, paired with the claim that knowledge requires belief, indicates contradictions in intuitive cases where knowledge seems belief-independent.**
