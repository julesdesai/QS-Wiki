**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification can be an infinite chain broken down into manageable finite segments by practical considerations**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and practical considerations allow for manageable finite segments of an infinite justification chain**
