## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person P believes that it will rain tomorrow based on a weather forecast that turns out to be accurate. Intuitively, we either have to say that P knows it will rain tomorrow or does not. If we say P knows, it challenges the fixed standard of justification. If we say P does not know, then accurate forecasts would not lead to knowledge.**, **A future contingent belief that turns out true does not align neatly with fixed standards of justification.**, **The role of contingency in future events poses a challenge to the fixed standard knowledge theory.**
