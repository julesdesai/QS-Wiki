## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief about the weather by observing the sky, an observation that is generally reliable and virtuous. However, unknown external factors, like a disrupted weather pattern unseen by the person, make the reasoning coincidentally accurate. Intuitively, we might judge that relying purely on their intellectual virtue does not suffice for knowledge here.**, **It is plausible that external truths and environmental factors can play a significant role in what is considered knowledge beyond intellectual virtues, challenging the sufficiency argument of this view.**
