## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person employs conflicting intellectual virtues to arrive at a true belief about a proposition, where each virtue might independently imply inconsistency**, **It is implausible to resolve such contradictions within the framework of intellectual virtue epistemology without undermining the notion of knowledge, suggesting that consistent application of virtues could be necessary**
