## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition that is true, but the truth is accidental and unconnected causally to their belief formation process. Intuitively, we might still think the person lacks knowledge due to the accidentality.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires beliefs connected to truths not by accident. If accidentality invalidates knowledge, this calls into question the sufficiency of causal connections when they result in accidentality.**
