## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires robustly true beliefs, not just beliefs that happen to be true. A belief that is only coincidentally true in the actual world, without being robustly true across nearby worlds, would not qualify as knowledge.**, **In a case where a belief is true in the actual world but easily false in nearby worlds due to minor changes, intuitively, this undermines the claim to knowledge.**
