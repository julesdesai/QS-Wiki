## Content

**A scenario involves a person who believes a true proposition that could easily have been false, such as flipping a coin that lands heads and believing it will land heads.**, **In such a scenario, the person is not usually considered to have knowledge of the proposition due to the chance nature of the coin flip.**, **This example suggests the possibility that the requirement that a belief could not easily have been false is not necessary for knowledge.**
