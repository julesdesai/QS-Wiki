## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is considered virtuous in the sciences but not in the humanities. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the personâ€™s intellectual virtues are domain-specific, affecting their capacity for knowledge in different areas.**, **It is implausible that a single intellectual virtue suffices across all domains for knowledge if substantial variations exist in requisite skills and understanding between fields.**
