**In a case where a person comes to believe a false proposition that unexpectedly becomes true due to an unforeseeable event, the person's belief could be considered initially correct due to the truth of the outcome.**, **This suggests that the truth of a proposition at the time of belief may not always be a necessary condition for a person to know a proposition.**
