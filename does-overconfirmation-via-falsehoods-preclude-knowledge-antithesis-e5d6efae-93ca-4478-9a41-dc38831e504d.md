## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a proposition based on solid, true evidence but seeks additional confirmation that happens to contain a false assumption unrelated to the core evidence. Intuitively, the added false assumption should not destroy the knowledge, given it's tangential.**, **A principle holds that unnecessary false evidence does not undercut knowledge when true support is already secure.**
