## Content

**There might exist a case where a person believes a true proposition, deriving it from cognitive faculties operating as they statistically tend to, but the environment is atypical and not "suitable" in a standard sense.**, **In this case, intuitively we might hesitate to attribute knowledge, questioning the necessity of a specific environment for proper function.**
