## Content

**Consider a scenario where the reliability of a process depends heavily on specific environmental contexts, and outside those contexts, the process is not reliable. Intuitively, knowledge should be context-independent, and if a belief does not hold reliably across contexts, it challenges the sufficiency of reliable processes for knowledge.**, **Suppose a person forms a belief using a process reliable in one context but unreliable in another. If the belief is only true in the suitable context, it challenges the idea that a reliable process alone is sufficient for knowledge.**
