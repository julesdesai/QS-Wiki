## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on instincts or emotions that are not traditionally considered intellectual virtues. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the person still possesses knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be obtained through various human faculties and not purely through intellectual virtue. This principle, together with the existence of knowledge from non-intellectual virtues, suggests that intellectual virtue alone may not be sufficient for knowledge.**
