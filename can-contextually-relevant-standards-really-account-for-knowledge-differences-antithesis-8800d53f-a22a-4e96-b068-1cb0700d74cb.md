## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people, Alice and Bob, are in different locations. Alice is in a high-stakes situation, while Bob is in a low-stakes situation regarding the same piece of information. Intuitively, Alice may need stricter standards of justification to claim knowledge than Bob. However, it seems implausible that the stakes could change the truth conditions of knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case where Bob's belief is true, and he has justification by low-stakes standards, yet Alice requires further justification by high-stakes standards. It is implausible that the same proposition can be known if the context changes while nothing about the fact itself has changed.**
