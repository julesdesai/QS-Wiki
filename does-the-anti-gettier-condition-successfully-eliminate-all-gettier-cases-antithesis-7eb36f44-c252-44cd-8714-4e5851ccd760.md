## Content

**Gettier cases often show true beliefs with justified evidence, yet the justification includes elements that could be coincidental, suggesting a lack of knowledge. Suppose a person forms a true belief supported by justification that involves false premises in a way that undercuts the epistemically relevant relation between the belief and truth. Intuitively, the presence of false premises seems an insufficient criterion to deny knowledge, making the Anti-Gettier condition questionable.**
