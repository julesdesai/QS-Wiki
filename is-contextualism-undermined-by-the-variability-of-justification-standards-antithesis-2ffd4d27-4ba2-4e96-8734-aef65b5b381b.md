## Content

**Suppose the justification standard for a proposition varies widely depending on who is asking the question and why. Intuitively, such variability suggests an instability in determining what constitutes knowledge, potentially leading to conflicting claims.**, **It is implausible that something as fundamental as knowledge could be so fluidly subject to who is making the inquiry without leading to contradictions or confusions.**
