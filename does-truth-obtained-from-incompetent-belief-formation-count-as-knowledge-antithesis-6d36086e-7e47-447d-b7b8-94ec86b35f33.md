## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief from a grossly incompetent or irrational process, such as believing that it will rain tomorrow because a childhood toy suggested so.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that a true belief acquired in this manner does not count as knowledge, as it lacks a basis in intellectual virtue or competence.**
