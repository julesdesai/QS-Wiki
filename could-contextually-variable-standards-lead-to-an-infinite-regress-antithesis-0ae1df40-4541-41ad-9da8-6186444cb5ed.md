## Content

**Suppose that for every judgment of knowledge, contextual standards require additional evidence or justification to be met. If contexts keep shifting upward epistically, it may necessitate an infinite regress of justifications.**, **If knowledge demands ever-increasing contextual standards, one might never fully satisfy the conditions to claim knowledge due to infinite regress concerns.**
