## Content

**In a scenario where a person claims knowledge based on an infinite chain of justifications, intuitively, we might question the sufficiency of such knowledge given practical reliance on finite arguments.**, **Consider a case in which a student justifies an understanding of basic math with a purported infinite chain. Intuitively, education and understanding generally rest on finite, well-grounded examples and principles, suggesting that infinite chains might be epistemically redundant.**
