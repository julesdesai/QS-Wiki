## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is given an accurate prediction due to a reliable process they are unaware of. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the prediction is true despite lacking internal awareness of the justification.**, **It is implausible to require internal awareness of justification for all cases of knowledge, as some knowledge may be acquired through reliable external processes.**
