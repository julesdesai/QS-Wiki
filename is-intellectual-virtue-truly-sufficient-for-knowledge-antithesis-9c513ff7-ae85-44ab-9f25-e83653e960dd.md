## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone forms a belief through intellectual virtue but does so in an environment designed to deceive, such as a virtual reality or a misleading simulation. Intuitively, we either have to say that such an environment undermines knowledge or that knowledge is independent of the belief-forming environment. If we say the environment undermines knowledge, then intellectual virtue alone is insufficient. If we say knowledge is independent, then the connection to reality is questioned.**, **It is implausible that knowledge formed through intellectual virtue is sufficient when deceptive environments are considered legitimate threats to true belief.**
