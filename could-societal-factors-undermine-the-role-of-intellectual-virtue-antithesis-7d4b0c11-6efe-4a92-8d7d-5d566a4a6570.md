## Content

**Consider a case where a person forms a true belief under the influence of societal norms rather than personal intellectual virtues, such as conforming to popular opinion. Intuitively, this seems to undermine the notion of virtue-based knowledge.**, **If societal factors can lead to true beliefs independently of intellectual virtue, the analysis might overemphasize personal virtue in knowledge acquisition.**
