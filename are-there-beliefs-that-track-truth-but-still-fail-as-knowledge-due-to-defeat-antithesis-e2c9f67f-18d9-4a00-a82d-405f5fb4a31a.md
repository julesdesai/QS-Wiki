## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition, which is true and tracks truth across nearby worlds, but there exists a reliable defeater for the belief that the person is unaware of. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition because it tracks truth or doesn't know due to the hidden defeater. If we say the person knows, then we ignore potential knowledge defeaters. If we say the person doesn't know, we acknowledge that truth-tracking alone cannot suffice for knowledge.**
