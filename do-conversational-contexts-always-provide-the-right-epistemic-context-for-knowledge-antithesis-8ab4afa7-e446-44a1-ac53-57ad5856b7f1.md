## Content

**Consider a scenario where two people are discussing an unknown scientific phenomenon in a conversational context, yet they reach the correct conclusion by mere speculation or guesswork rather than evidence-based reasoning. Intuitively, their true belief doesn't seem to qualify as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that right epistemic context should involve proper evidence and reasoning rather than mere conversational participation.**
