## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes it is noon, their clock shows noon, and it is, in fact, noon, but the clock has stopped working. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows it is noon or they do not know. If we say they know, then we accept knowledge with false justification. If we say they do not know, then justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge.**
