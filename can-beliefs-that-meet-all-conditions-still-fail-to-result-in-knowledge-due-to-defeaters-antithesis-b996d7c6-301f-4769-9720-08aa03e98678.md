## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person reads an accurate report that it will rain tomorrow, and this report makes them believe it will rain. Later, they hear a false rumor that the report was retracted, though they continue to believe it will rain. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person no longer knows it will rain because the rumor acts as a defeater.**, **A plausible principle is that for knowledge, the absence of defeaters is crucial. Even if a belief is justified, true, and contextually adequate, the presence of an undefeated false belief can prevent knowledge.**
