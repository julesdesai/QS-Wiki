## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person includes a false but coherent belief due to misinformation into their belief system. In this scenario, intuitively we would judge that the entire system might be compromised as knowledge-bearing.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge systems should resist manipulation by false beliefs. This principle, together with the ease of introducing false beliefs into a coherent system, suggests coherence might not be robust enough for knowledge.**
