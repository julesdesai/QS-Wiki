## Content

**Consider a scientist who maintains coherence within an accepted scientific framework instead of adopting a groundbreaking theory. Intuitively, we would judge that their claim to knowledge is limited if it excludes potential new truths.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires openness to revising beliefs when new truths emerge. This principle suggests that strict adherence to coherence might restrict access to new knowledge.**
