## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people are in different contexts, with one insisting they 'know' a fact while the other denies it based on a higher standard. Intuitively, we would judge that this leads to an irresolvable disagreement, which is counterproductive in a discourse.**, **Suppose we have a case in which knowledge is claimed in a casual conversation, but questioned in a formal context. Intuitively, if context alone can account for whether knowledge persists, then disagreements about knowledge cannot be resolved, undermining meaningful dialogue.**, **It is implausible that language alone, depending on context, can shift the truth value of knowledge claims, as meaningful communication requires more stability than contextually variable knowledge can offer.**
