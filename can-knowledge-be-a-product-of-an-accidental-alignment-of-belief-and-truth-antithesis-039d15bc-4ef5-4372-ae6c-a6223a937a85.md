## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person named Jordan develops a belief based on a faulty premise but coincidentally, the belief is true. Intuitively, we might judge that Jordan does not know the proposition, as the truth was accidental and not due to any intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a non-accidental correlation between belief and truth. This principle suggests that accident-prone methods should not yield knowledge even if beliefs happen to be true.**
