## Content

**Suppose a person relies on a properly functioning barometer to believe it will rain, and it does rain, but the barometer works accurately by luck due to external interferences. Intuitively, this doesn't seem to constitute knowledge despite causal connection.**, **A reliance on unreliable causal chains, such as malfunctioning devices that occasionally deliver correct results, undermines the credibility of the belief as knowledge despite a coincidental truth.**
