## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Ann, correctly uses a formula to calculate a complex math problem without believing she applied it correctly. Intuitively, we might judge she lacks belief in the proposition despite reaching a true and justified conclusion.**, **A plausible principle is that belief is a necessary condition for knowledge, yet one can demonstrate knowledge with certainty without explicit belief.**
