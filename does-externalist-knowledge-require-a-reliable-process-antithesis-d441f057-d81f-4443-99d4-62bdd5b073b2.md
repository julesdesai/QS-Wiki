## Content

**Consider a person who forms a true belief based on sporadically reliable processes, such as a typically malfunctioning clock that happens to show the correct time. Intuitively, we judge that this does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is plausible to argue that consistent reliability of the process leading to true belief is necessary for knowledge, posing a challenge to externalist views that focus simply on the occurrence of truth and belief.**
