## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on what they take to be a self-evident belief, but the proposition turns out to be false. In such a scenario, intuitively, we must question whether the belief was truly self-evident.**, **It is plausible that a foundational belief must be infallible if it is truly self-evident. If we accept this, then a belief that turns out to be false suggests it was not self-evident after all.**
