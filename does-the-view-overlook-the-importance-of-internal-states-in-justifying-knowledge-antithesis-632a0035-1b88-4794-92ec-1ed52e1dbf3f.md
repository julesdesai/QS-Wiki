## Content

**It is implausible that external justification alone can provide sufficient grounds for knowledge without considering a person's internal states.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has a true belief with external justification but is unaware of this justification and possesses misleading internal evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not truly know the proposition.**
