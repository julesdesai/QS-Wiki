## Content

**Suppose we have a case where variable contexts, such as different professions with their unique jargon and standards, each claim foundational beliefs for knowledge. Intuitively, disparate contexts could lead to conflicting foundational beliefs, calling into question how permissive foundationalism must be to accommodate them all.**, **It is plausible that truly foundational knowledge should withstand scrutiny across contexts, so the multiplicity and variability suggest that account of knowledge might be inadequately permissive.**
