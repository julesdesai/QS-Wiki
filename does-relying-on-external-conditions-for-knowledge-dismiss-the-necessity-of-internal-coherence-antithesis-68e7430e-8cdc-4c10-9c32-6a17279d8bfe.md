## Content

**Relying on only external conditions for knowledge dismisses the necessity of the belief fitting coherently into the person's existing body of knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition due to external conditions, but the proposition is incoherent with their other beliefs. In such a case, intuitively, coherence seems crucial for knowledge.**
