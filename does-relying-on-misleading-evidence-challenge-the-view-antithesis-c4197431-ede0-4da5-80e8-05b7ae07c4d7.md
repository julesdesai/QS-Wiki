## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on misleading but true evidence. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not have knowledge because the evidence misleadingly points to a false conclusion.**, **There is a plausible principle that if one's evidence misleadingly supports a false conclusion, then one's belief, even if true, does not amount to knowledge.**
