## Content

**Imagine a case where a person has overwhelming evidence for a true proposition, yet hypothetically this evidence could be fake in a highly specific counterfactual scenario. Intuitively, we would still judge that the person knows the proposition despite the counterfactual deception scenario.**, **It is implausible to require that a belief would not persist under such rare and specific counterfactual scenarios, as this sets too high a bar for ordinary knowledge.**
