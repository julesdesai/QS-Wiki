## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person P has a justified true belief that someone in their office owns a Ford based on testimony and then happens to be true by coincidence. Intuitively, we would judge that P does not know that someone in their office owns a Ford.**, **A justified true belief that coheres with foundational beliefs can still fail to be knowledge if it is true by coincidence rather than due to the justification.**
