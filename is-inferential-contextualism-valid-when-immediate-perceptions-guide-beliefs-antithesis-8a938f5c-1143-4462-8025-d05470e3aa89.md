## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person immediately perceives a red apple in front of them and believes it is red without any inferential processes involved. Intuitively, we would judge that this person knows the apple's color.**, **There is a plausible principle that some instances of knowledge arise directly from immediate perceptions rather than through inferential processes. This principle together with the immediate perception of the apple's color entails that inferential justification may not be necessary for all knowledge.**
