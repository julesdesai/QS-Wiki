## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone, Smith, has a justified true belief because his belief is based on a usually reliable source but arrives at the true conclusion by sheer luck due to a misleading context. Intuitively, we would judge that Smith does not know the proposition, as the belief was not properly connected to the truth.**, **It is implausible that a reliable process alone is sufficient since reliability does not account for the luck involved in Gettier cases, which challenges the view that these conditions are sufficient for knowledge.**
