**Imagine a scenario where a person correctly identifies a distant ship as a pirate based on silhouettes. The belief would change in a world where identical-looking ships are known to be friendly but appears no different for the current belief holder in this world.**, **This scenario challenges the idea that knowledge depends on counterfactual differences about indistinguishable parallels if all apparent observations verify the belief.**
