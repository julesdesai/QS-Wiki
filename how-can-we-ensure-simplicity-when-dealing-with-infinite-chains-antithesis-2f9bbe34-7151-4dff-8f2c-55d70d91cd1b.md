## Content

**Consider the challenge of accurately determining which of two infinite chains is simpler. Intuitively, judging simplicity over infinite sets is highly complex.**, **It is implausible that simplicity can serve as an effective criterion when comparing infinite chains of reasons.**, **There exists no clear method for finitely establishing the simplicity of one infinite chain over another, raising doubts about preference for simplest chains.**
