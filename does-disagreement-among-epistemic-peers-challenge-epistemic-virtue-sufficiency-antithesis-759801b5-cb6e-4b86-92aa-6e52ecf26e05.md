## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two individuals, both epistemic peers, disagree on a proposition despite both exercising their epistemic virtues. Intuitively, we would judge that at least one of them lacks knowledge of the proposition, but both seem to meet conditions of exercising epistemic virtues.**, **It is implausible that both individuals can possess knowledge if their conclusions are mutually exclusive, suggesting that epistemic virtues alone may not suffice for knowledge.**
