## Content

**Consider the complexity of interconnected beliefs where one belief often supports or depends on another. In explaining a season's change, a person might reference Earth's tilt and rotation. Each component can appear in different explanations, suggesting belief interconnectedness. Infinitism disregards this interconnectedness by mandating non-repeating reasons, neglecting such real-world reliance and possibly dismantling plausible knowledge accounts.**
