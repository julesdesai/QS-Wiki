## Content

**Suppose a person holds a moral belief that aligns with the social norms of their community and is considered justified within that context due to consensus. Even if the belief is true, under more diverse or stricter ethical scrutiny, intuitively, it seems such a moral proposition may not constitute knowledge given lack of broader justification.**, **It is implausible that moral beliefs, when purported as knowledge, can depend entirely on local justifications without inviting scrutiny from broader ethical discourse, which could challenge their validity.**
