## Content

**Consider a situation where a gambler believes a horse will win based on a hunch and the horse wins solely by chance during an unexpected thunderstorm causing other horses to falter. Intuitively, we would not say this person knew the horse would win, even though there are no defeaters that undermine their justification.**, **An implication of the No-Defeaters View is that absent defeaters and true belief suffice for knowledge, which conflicts with our intuition in luck-based scenarios.**, **The absence of defeaters misses other factors, such as how the belief was formed, necessary to determine knowledge.**
