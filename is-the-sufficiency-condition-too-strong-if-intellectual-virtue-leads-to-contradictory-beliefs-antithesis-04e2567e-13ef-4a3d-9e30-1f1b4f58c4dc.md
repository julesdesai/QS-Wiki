## Content

**Suppose we have a case where two individuals form beliefs through intellectual virtue, yet their beliefs are in direct contradiction due to differing interpretive frameworks or methodologies. Intuitively, if both are said to have knowledge, this challenges the sufficiency of intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible that intellectual virtue provides sufficient conditions for knowledge if contradiction results in competing valid knowledge claims.**
