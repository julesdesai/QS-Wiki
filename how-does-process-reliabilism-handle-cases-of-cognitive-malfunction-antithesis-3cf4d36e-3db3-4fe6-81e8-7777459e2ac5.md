## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person accurately believes a proposition due to a reliable cognitive process that generally works well, but the same process malfunctions sporadically due to temporary cognitive anomaly. Intuitively, it seems wrong to attribute knowledge when the process behind the belief is randomly unreliable.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing requires not only reliability but also consistent non-fluky operation of the cognitive process. A case of cognitive malfunction tests this principle by allowing episodic unreliability in an otherwise reliable process.**
