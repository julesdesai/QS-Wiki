## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a proposition based on belief, truth, and reliable process, but a known defeater exists that should have blocked the belief had the person known it. Intuitively, we would judge that the presence of the defeater removes the status of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot coexist with known defeaters that undermine the justification of a belief. This principle suggests that the mere presence of a defeater, even unknown, can threaten a knowledge claim.**
