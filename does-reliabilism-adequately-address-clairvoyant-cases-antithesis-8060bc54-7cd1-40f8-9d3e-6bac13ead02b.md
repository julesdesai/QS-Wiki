## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone regularly has reliably produced beliefs about future events through an unknown clairvoyant power. Intuitively, we would have to say that the person does not know these future events despite the reliable production of their belief.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be attributed in a scenario where the agent is unaware of the source of their belief. This challenges the sufficiency of reliable belief production for knowledge.**
