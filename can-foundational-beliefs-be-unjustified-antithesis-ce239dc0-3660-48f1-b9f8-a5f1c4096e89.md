## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a foundational belief they hold without justification. Intuitively, we would judge that their belief in the proposition is not knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that beliefs used to justify other beliefs should themselves be justified. This principle, together with the existence of unjustified foundational beliefs, suggests that having a foundational belief without justification undermines knowledge.**
