**Consider a scenario like a classic Gettier case where a person, Smith, believes "The person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket" because he sees evidence for it, but ultimately he himself gets the job and it turns out he has ten coins by chance. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Smith lacks knowledge even though his belief is justified and true.**, **There is a plausible principle arising from Gettier cases that justified true belief can sometimes fail to account for knowledge. This principle together with the unusual case where a belief ends up true by coincidence entails that justification and truth alone are not sufficient for knowledge.**
