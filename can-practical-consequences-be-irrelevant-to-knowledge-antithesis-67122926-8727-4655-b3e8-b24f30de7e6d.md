## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Alice, believes a true proposition about the distant universe that has no practical consequences for her life. Intuitively, we would judge that Alice knows this proposition.**, **The notion that practical consequences are necessary for knowing a proposition seems to overlook knowledge of facts that exist independently of human interests or practical implications.**, **In many domains, such as pure mathematics or theoretical physics, propositions are known regardless of whether they have practical consequences, suggesting practical consequences are not necessary for knowledge.**
