## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition based on evidence containing no false premises, such as forming a belief that the road is wet because it rained, based on witnessing rain. In this case, intuitively, their knowledge should be secure.**, **There is a plausible principle that having no false supporting premises contributes significantly to constituting knowledge. This principle suggests the safety condition insufficiently describes secure knowledge.**
