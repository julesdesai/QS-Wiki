**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes their friend can play piano because they've seen them play before, but unbeknownst to them, the friend was merely miming to a recording. Across similar situations with the same setup, their belief stays true. Intuitively, we either have to say that their belief amounts to knowledge or that it's misleading. If we say it amounts to knowledge, then it implies knowledge can be based on an inaccurate impression. If we say itâ€™s misleading, then sensitivity to similar situations alone doesn't suffice for knowledge.**
