## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a scientific claim without understanding or reason, purely based on a hunch, and it tracks the truth. Intuitively, this seems to lack the depth that we require for knowledge.**, **A belief can align with the truth accidentally or coincidentally, which is not sufficient for it to be considered knowledge, even if it tracks the truth.**
