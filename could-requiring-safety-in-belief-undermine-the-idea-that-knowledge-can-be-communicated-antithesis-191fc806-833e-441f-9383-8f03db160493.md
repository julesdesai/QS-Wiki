## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person learns a true fact from a trustworthy source about a scheduled event, but unknown to them, external factors made the event's occurrence nearly unlikely. Intuitively, we would judge that the learner knows the fact about the event as learned from the source, ignoring the unknown probabilities, which may challenge the necessity of widely known and communicated facts being subject to a strict criteria of safety.**, **It is implausible that disseminators of knowledge, like experts, should be denied holding knowledge due to rare, unknown contradictions to the core of what they know, as it would make shared knowledge practically impossible.**
