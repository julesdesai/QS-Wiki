## Content

**It is plausible to consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, and the belief is true. However, the cognitive environment is subtly distorted, leading to unreliable cognitive processes.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not truly know the proposition despite the belief being true and properly resulting from cognitive processes.**
