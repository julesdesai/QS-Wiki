## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition at one time but later forgets it, yet the proposition remains true and coherent with their other beliefs. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows the proposition when they have forgotten it.**, **There is a plausible principle that for belief to result in knowledge, one must actively maintain or be able to recall the belief. This principle together with the forgotten proposition scenario suggests that mere past coherence is insufficient for knowledge.**
