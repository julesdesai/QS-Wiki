## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on incomplete evidence that doesn't rule out all relevant alternatives. Intuitively, we might say the person has a true belief but lacks knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that true belief can occur without knowledge when there are relevant alternatives that haven't been adequately addressed through justification.**
