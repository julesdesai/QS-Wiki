## Content

**Suppose we imagine a person, Alice, who walks by a field and sees what appears to be a sheep and thus believes there is a sheep in the field. Unknown to Alice, it is actually a cleverly disguised dog in this world, but in nearly all nearby possible worlds, there is actually a sheep in that spot instead of the dog.**, **Alice believes the proposition "there is a sheep in the field," and in nearly all nearby possible worlds in which she forms this belief, it is true, meeting the safety condition.**, **Intuitively, we would hesitate to say Alice knows there is a sheep in the field because her belief is based on a deception, yet the safety condition considers her belief as knowledge.**
