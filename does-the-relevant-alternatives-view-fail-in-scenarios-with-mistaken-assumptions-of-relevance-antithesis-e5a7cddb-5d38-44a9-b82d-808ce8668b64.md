## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone mistakenly assumes irrelevant alternatives as relevant and thus invests effort in ruling them out, while ignoring actual relevant alternatives. Intuitively, we might say this undermines the person's claim to know the proposition.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires ruling out alternatives that might not actually be relevant due to mistaken assumptions, challenging how one establishes what alternatives should be considered relevant.**
