## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition through intellectual virtue, but a Gettier-type situation intervenes. Intuitively, such cases do not count as true knowledge despite satisfying the sufficiency conditions proposed.**, **There is a plausible principle that Gettier cases are counterexamples to any proposed sufficient conditions for knowledge.**
