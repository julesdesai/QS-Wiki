## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition based on a reliable source, but in nearby possible worlds, the source is unreliable. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows the proposition.**, **A proposition that could easily have been false in a similar situation does not seem to meet the intuitive standard for knowledge.**, **If knowledge requires truth and belief to be sufficiently safe from error, then many cases of intuitive knowledge would be ruled out.**
