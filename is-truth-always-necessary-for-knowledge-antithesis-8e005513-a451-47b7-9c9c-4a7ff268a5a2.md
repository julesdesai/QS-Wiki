## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a false proposition but holds this belief with such confidence and consistency due to significant supporting evidence that it guides their actions successfully. Intuitively, we might still hesitate to say that they know this false proposition, even if it guides action effectively.**, **A principle might assert that truth is not necessary for action-guiding successful beliefs which operate similarly to knowledge. This principle challenges the claim that truth is necessary for knowledge by suggesting an effective alternate route where absence of truth does not rule out knowledge-like situations.**
