## Content

**There is a plausible principle that epistemic virtues like sensitivity to evidence can independently contribute to knowledge, beyond truth, belief, and causation.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person's knowledge is more accurately attributed to their attentiveness and open-mindedness rather than a direct causal link to the truth. Intuitively, these virtues seem to play a role in knowledge that the causal theory does not account for.**
