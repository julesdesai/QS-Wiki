## Content

**Intuitively, we might judge that a person knows a proposition about everyday matters, like "I have hands"**, **If the proposition "I have hands" were false, in many remote or skeptical scenarios, the person would still believe it**, **Because they would believe it even if false, on the sensitivity condition alone, we might have to say they do not know it, which contradicts the intuition**
