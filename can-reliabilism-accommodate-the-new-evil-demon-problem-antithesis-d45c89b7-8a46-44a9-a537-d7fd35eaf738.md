## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is deceived by an evil demon, resulting in them having beliefs that are, unbeknownst to them, false. These beliefs are produced by the same cognitive processes that would be reliable if not for the demon. Intuitively, we would judge that such a person is justified in their beliefs despite their unreliability.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification should not depend solely on external factors like environmental truth conditions. This principle suggests that reliabilism might wrongly deny justification to demon-world beliefs.**
