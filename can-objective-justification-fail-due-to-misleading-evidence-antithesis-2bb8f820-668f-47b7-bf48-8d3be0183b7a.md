## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has objective justification for a belief based on evidence that is later revealed to be misleading, yet the belief remains true. In such a case, intuitively, this fails to qualify as knowledge.**, **Having objective justification based on misleading circumstances that lead to accidentally correct beliefs challenges the sufficiency of justified true belief for knowledge.**
