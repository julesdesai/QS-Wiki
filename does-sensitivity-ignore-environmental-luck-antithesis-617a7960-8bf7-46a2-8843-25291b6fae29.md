## Content

**Consider a person who knows P in one environment due to a lucky alignment of conditions, whereas P would be false in almost any alternative nearby environment. Intuitively, this knowledge seems suspect due to environmental luck, more so than sensitivity failure.**, **Environmental factors underline an inadequacy of sensitivity, as it may ignore how environmental luck affects the status of knowledge claims.**
