## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person claims to know a historical fact based on a casual conversation with a friend, which meets contextual justification standards. In a different context, a historian using rigorous archival methods does not believe the same fact is true because it does not meet higher academic standards. Both parties have conflicting claims to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that true knowledge claims should not be contradictory. The fact that contextually set justification standards can lead to contradictory knowledge claims challenges the coherence of the contextualist approach.**
