## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a process typically reliable, yet influenced by cognitive bias. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge the belief as lacking knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires immunity to bias. This principle implies that a reliably produced belief is not knowledge if compromised by bias.**
