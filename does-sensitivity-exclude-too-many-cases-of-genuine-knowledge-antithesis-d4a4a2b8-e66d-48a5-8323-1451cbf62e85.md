## Content

**Consider the case of historical knowledge, where a person knows a historical fact through study and evidence, but would still believe it due to the persistence of the belief regardless of new contrary evidence. Intuitively, we regard this as genuine knowledge even if sensitivity is not met.**, **Historical knowledge can depend on firm well-supported beliefs, which might not change under counterfactual scenarios, yet we still consider these as cases of knowing.**
