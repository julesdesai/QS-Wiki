## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, the criteria used to set standards must themselves be justified and not arbitrary.**, **Contextualism allows that different contexts can set different standards, potentially arbitrarily.**, **If these varying standards are not justified beyond stating they vary by context, contextualism may lead to unjustifiable arbitrariness in determining what counts as knowledge.**
