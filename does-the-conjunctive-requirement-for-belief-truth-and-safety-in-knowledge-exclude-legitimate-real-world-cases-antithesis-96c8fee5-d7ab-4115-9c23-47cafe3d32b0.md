## Content

**A real-world scenario involves someone forming a true belief about an event using standard methods but under rapidly changing conditions which could easily alter the outcome.**, **The shift quickly enough to make the belief unsafe under the conjunctive safety condition.**, **This suggests that while the belief is reasonable and true, the application of the safety condition might exclude it from being considered knowledge.**
