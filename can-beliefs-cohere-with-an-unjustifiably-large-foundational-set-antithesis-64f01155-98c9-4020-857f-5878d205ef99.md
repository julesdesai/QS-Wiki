## Content

**It is implausible that a belief can be justified merely through coherence if the foundational set of beliefs is excessively large and unverifiable.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person holds a belief that coheres with a vast foundational set of beliefs, each unverifiable individually. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that coherence does not suffice for establishing knowledge.**
