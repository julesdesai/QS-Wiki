## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person gains a true belief due to the exercise of intellectual virtue, yet their belief remains true due to a one-time coincidence or chance occurrence. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the presence of luck undermines the sufficiency of virtuous reasoning alone in ascribing knowledge.**
