## Content

**There is a plausible principle that reliable cognitive processes generally lead to true beliefs. This principle together with the occurrence of occasional false beliefs by such processes entails that reliability does not guarantee truth.**, **Suppose we have a case where a generally reliable process produces a true belief mostly but occasionally a false one. Intuitively, we have uncertainty whether the truth is guaranteed.**
