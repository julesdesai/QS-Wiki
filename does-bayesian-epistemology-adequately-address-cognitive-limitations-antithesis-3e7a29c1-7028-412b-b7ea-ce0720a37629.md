## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief based on a simplification due to cognitive limitations rather than full alignment with probabilistic reasoning. Intuitively, if the belief is true and based on evidence, we might still consider this as knowledge.**, **It is implausible to require that all knowledge attributions involve actual probabilistic reasoning, as human cognitive capacities are limited and often rely on heuristics and rules of thumb.**
