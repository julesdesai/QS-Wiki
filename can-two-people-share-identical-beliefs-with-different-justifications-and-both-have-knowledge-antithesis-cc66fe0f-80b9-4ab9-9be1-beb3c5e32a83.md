## Content

**Consider two detectives who independently believe a suspect is guilty: one based on solid evidence, the other on a hunch. The solid evidence supports genuine knowledge, but the hunch, despite being true, does not. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge arises in one case but not the other**, **There is a plausible principle that the quality of justification affects the attainment of knowledge. This principle together with the belief and its truth suggests differing levels of justification impact whether knowledge is gained**
