## Content

**Imagine a person looking at a lifelike sculpture of a cat that they perceive as a real cat. Intuitively, if the sculpture were removed, they would not believe there is a cat, so the sensitivity condition fails to capture their error.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that if the proposition were false, the person would not believe it, yet sensory illusions can still create false beliefs.**
