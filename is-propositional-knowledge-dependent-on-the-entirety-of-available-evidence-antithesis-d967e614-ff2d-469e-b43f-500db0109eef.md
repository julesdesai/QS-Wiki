## Content

**Consider a scenario where a personâ€™s belief in a proposition is true and supported by currently available evidence, but there exists stronger contradictory evidence unknown to them. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge since their belief could easily be defeated by the undiscovered evidence.**, **A plausible principle suggests that knowledge requires not just current support but resilience to potential objections revealed by new evidence.**
