## Content

**It is implausible that knowledge claims can remain stable if later changes in context can alter past justification, yet contextualism implies this possibility exists.**, **Suppose someone knows a proposition in a context but a shift in context retrospectively changes what counts as justification. Intuitively, this threatens the stability of knowledge over time.**
