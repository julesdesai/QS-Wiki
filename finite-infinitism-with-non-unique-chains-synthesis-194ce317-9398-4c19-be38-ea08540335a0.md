## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification can involve finite but extensible chains where neither uniqueness nor infinitude is required initially**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and chains of reasons justifying the belief can grow without bounds without needing uniqueness from the start**
