## Content

**Suppose a person P holds a true belief that fits within a coherent system established by chance rather than reliable processes. Intuitively, the truth of P's belief is insufficient for knowledge without a proper causal basis.**, **Truth on its own, even within a coherent system, does not guarantee that a belief amounts to knowledge.**
