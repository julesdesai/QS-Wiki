## Content

**Consider a mathematical truth, such as 2 + 2 = 4, believed by someone without understanding. Intuitively, this person does not know this truth, despite it being true in all worlds.**, **The constraint of nearby worlds is irrelevant for necessary truths, challenging the applicability of safety to cases of knowledge involving necessary propositions.**
