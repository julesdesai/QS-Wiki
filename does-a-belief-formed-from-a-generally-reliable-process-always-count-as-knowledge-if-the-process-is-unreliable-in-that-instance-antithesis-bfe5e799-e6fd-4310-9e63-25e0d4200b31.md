## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a normally reliable cognitive process fails in a particular instance, leading to a true belief by sheer luck. Intuitively, we might be reluctant to say the belief is knowledge because the process failed in this instance.**, **It is implausible that a true belief obtained by a failed or misfiring cognitive process can constitute knowledge even if the process is generally reliable.**
