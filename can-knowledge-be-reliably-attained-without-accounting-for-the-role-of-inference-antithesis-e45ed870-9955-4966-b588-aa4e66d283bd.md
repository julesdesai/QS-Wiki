## Content

**A hypothetical situation involves a reliable process that skips inferential steps to arrive at true beliefs. In this case, intuitively, we would not grant knowledge without proper reasoning.**, **It is implausible that processes bypassing inference entirely can provide true, justified beliefs without considering the inferential structure.**
