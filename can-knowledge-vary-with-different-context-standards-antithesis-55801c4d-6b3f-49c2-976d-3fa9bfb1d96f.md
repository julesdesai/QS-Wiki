## Content

**Imagine a scenario in which a student states they know their examination result because they passed according to their teacher's standard, but not according to an external standardized body. Intuitively, it seems odd that knowledge could change simply by referencing a different standard.**, **There is a plausible principle that the truth of knowledge claims should not change based on different contextual standards; this principle seems to contradict the context-dependence of justification in knowledge claims.**
