## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alice, forms a true belief about the time by reading a clock that stopped 24 hours earlier. Intuitively, it seems Alice does not know the time, even though her belief is true.**, **It is plausible that Alice's belief about the time being only true due to the coincidence of looking at the clock at the right moment reflects epistemic luck. This implies that merely excluding epistemic luck in a belief may not be sufficient for knowledge.**
