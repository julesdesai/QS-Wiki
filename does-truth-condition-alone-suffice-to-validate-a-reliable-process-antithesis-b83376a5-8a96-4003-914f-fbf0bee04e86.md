## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition that happens to be true merely by coincidence, such as predicting the winner of a sports match without any evidence or method. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not possess knowledge of the outcome, despite the truth of the belief.**, **It is plausible to assert that the belief in question should not only be true but derive from relevant evidence or justifiable reasoning alongside reliability for it to qualify as knowledge.**
