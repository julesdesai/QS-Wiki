## Content

**Imagine a belief true in some possible worlds but false in others, including certain nearby ones. Intuitively, this irregular distribution suggests the belief is not safe.**, **If a belief being true is dependent on specific worlds existing where the belief is true, and others where it is not, it undermines the idea that the belief is safely true.**
