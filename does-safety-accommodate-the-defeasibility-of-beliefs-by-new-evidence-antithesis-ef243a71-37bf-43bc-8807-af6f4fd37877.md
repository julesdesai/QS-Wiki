## Content

**Consider a scenario where Ian holds a true, justified belief but would change this belief given new evidence that is not currently available to him. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge this belief may not be safely based on stable truth.**, **It is plausible that knowledge requires robustness against potential evidence that could feasibly emerge.**
