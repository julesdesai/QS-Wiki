## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual's reliable cognitive process is influenced by external manipulations like brainwashing or deceptive environments, yet forms a true belief. Intuitively, it is troubling to attribute knowledge here due to the interference.**, **Imagine a case where a usually reliable internal process, like memory, is unknowingly affected by a memory-altering drug leading to a coincidentally true belief. Attributing knowledge in this situation feels inappropriate.**
