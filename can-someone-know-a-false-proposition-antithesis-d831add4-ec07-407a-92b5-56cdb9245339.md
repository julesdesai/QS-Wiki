## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition that is ultimately false, yet all available evidence supports its truth. Intuitively, we would judge that under these circumstances, the person does not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, the proposition must be true. This principle together with the scenario implies that the person does not have knowledge despite having supporting evidence.**
