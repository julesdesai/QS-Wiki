## Content

**A plausible principle is that justification and truth should align to constitute knowledge. This principle, together with cases where beliefs are justified and true in nearby worlds but due to incorrect reasoning, suggests they might still lack knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which a gambler justifies belief in winning a bet based not on skill but on superstitious rituals, and wins. Intuitively, we would judge that the belief lacks knowledge despite being true.**
