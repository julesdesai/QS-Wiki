## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is supported by external conditions which shield it from defeasibility due to future evidence**
