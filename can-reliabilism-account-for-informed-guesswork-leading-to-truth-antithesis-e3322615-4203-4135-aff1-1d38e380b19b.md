## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual makes an informed guess supported by generally reliable reasoning patterns, resulting in a true belief by chance. Intuitively, we would judge that this informed guess does not equate to knowledge because the truth was coincidental.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should not depend partially on luck. Here, informed guesswork leading to accidental truths defies this principle, challenging its sufficiency for knowledge.**
