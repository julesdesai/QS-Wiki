## Content

**Suppose an archer, through great skill, aims and fires an arrow at a target. However, a gust of wind alters its course, but it still hits the bullseye accidentally. Intuitively, we either have to say that the archer's skill is responsible for the outcome, or that it was serendipitous. If we say the archer's skill is responsible, then it suggests knowledge can be attributed to accidental success, which is implausible.**, **In this scenario, intuitively, knowledge seems misplaced despite the involvement of significant skill, because the final outcome relied on luck.**
