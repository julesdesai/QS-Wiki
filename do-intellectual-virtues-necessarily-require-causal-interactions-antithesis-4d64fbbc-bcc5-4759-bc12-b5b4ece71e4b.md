## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtues can exist independently of direct causal connections to the truth. This raises questions about the necessity of causality in virtue epistemology.**, **Suppose we have an instance where an individual draws a warranted conclusion based on principles or insight, without evident causal interaction. Intuitively, this conclusion appears to stem from intellectual virtue.**
