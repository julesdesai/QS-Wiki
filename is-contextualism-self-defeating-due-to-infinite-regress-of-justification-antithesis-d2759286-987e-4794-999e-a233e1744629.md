## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person claims to know a fact because it is justified contextually. Intuitively, for any justification to be contextually appropriate, there should be a further justification to support why this context counts.**, **There is a plausible principle that requiring contextually variable justification implies a demand for higher-level considerations of context. This creates an infinite regress of justifications, as each contextual justification requires a further one.**
