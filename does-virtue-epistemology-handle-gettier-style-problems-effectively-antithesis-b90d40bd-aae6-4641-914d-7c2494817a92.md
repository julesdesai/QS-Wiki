## Content

**Suppose we have a Gettier-style scenario where a person has a justified true belief formed through intellectual virtue, but their conclusion is true due to an error in reasoning being counterbalanced by accidental truth. Intuitively, we might judge the person does not truly have knowledge because their true conclusion is based on faulty reasoning.**, **It is implausible that virtue epistemology sufficiently resolves Gettier problems if knowledge attribution persists despite reasoning mistakes.**
