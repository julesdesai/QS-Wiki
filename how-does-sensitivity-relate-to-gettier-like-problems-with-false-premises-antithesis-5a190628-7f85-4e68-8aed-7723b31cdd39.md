## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person Kyle infers the winner based on false media reports that one player was leading substantially. Kyle believes this player will win, which turns out to be true when the player wins by a narrow margin. Although sensitivity to the actual event might lead Kyle not to believe a false outcome, the basis for belief was initially false. Intuitively, Kyle doesn't know the winner based on the media reports misleading, despite meeting sensitivity conditions.**, **The causal connection required for knowledge seems lacking in Kyle's example, where the sensitivity approach provides insufficient epistemic differentiation when initial mistaken beliefs lead serendipitously to truth.**
