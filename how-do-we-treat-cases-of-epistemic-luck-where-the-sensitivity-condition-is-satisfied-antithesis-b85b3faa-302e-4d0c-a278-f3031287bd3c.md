## Content

**Consider someone who forms a true belief about the outcome of a coin flip, where their belief coincidentally aligns with the result despite not being based on any understanding of probabilities. The condition of sensitivity is satisfied as the belief would not be held if the proposition were false, e.g., if the coin landed the other way. Intuitively, we are reluctant to grant knowledge due to the luck involved.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be resilient across variations, which is not appropriately captured if chance occurrences satisfy the sensitivity condition despite forming true beliefs.**
