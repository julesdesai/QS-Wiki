## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows a proposition based on current coherent beliefs. Suddenly, new evidence emerges that disrupts this coherence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person's knowledge of the proposition has been undermined.**, **Knowledge should be stable across changes in evidence, yet coherence-based knowledge can be disrupted by new evidence, suggesting that coherence is insufficient for stable knowledge.**
