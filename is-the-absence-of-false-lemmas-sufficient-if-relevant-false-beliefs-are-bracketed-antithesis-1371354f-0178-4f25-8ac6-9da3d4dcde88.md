## Content

**Suppose a person brackets a false belief to insulate it from their reasoning while arriving at a true belief about a proposition. Even if the current reasoning does not rely directly on the false belief, intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks full knowledge.**, **A scenario where one compartmentalizes false beliefs to avoid contradictions but still believes a true proposition involves indirect reliance on falsity that can affect knowledge attribution. This questions whether absence of direct false lemmas is sufficient for the assertion of knowledge.**
