## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition based on evidence that is generally reliable but misleading due to an unusual coincidence. Intuitively, either we have to say that the safety condition prevents knowledge or it does not. If it does not prevent knowledge, then this seems to allow for knowledge despite epistemic luck. If it does, then the safety condition fails to adequately handle all cases of epistemic luck.**, **It is implausible that a belief’s truth in nearby possible worlds sufficiently rules out epistemic luck, which might still undermine the belief’s status as knowledge.**
