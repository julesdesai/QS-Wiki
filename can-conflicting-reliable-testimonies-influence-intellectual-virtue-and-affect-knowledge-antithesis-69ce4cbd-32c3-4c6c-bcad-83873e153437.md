## Content

**Suppose an investigator relies on witness testimonies, known for their accuracy, but receives conflicting accounts from equally reliable sources. Intuitively, the investigator's belief may utilize intellectual virtue, yet it does not amount to knowledge due to conflicting evidence.**, **The principle that intellectual virtue is enough for belief formation must contend with external inconsistencies overriding the potential for knowledge. As such, conflicting reliable sources challenge the sufficiency of virtue epistemology.**
