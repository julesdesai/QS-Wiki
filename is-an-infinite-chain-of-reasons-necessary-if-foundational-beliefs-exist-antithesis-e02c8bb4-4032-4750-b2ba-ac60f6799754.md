## Content

**A foundational belief is a belief that does not require justification from other beliefs, yet it can justify other beliefs. Foundationalism suggests we can have knowledge through foundational beliefs without needing infinite reasons.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person holds foundational beliefs that adequately justify their belief in a proposition. Intuitively, it seems they could know the proposition without an infinite chain of reasons.**
