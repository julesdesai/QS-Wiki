## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a person believes in a scientifically proven theory because it is true and justified, even if they find it useful only for intellectual satisfaction. Intuitively, either we have to say this is knowledge or deny it. Denying would make the need for perceived practical usefulness implausible.**, **In a situation where historical knowledge of a past event helps a historian create a narrative but doesnâ€™t alter practical behavior, the need for utility as a justification is challenged.**
