## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone predicts a stock market rise due to their knowledge of economic indicators. The stock indeed rises, but its rise is actually due to an unforeseen geopolitical event. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge due to their evidence or they do not due to the accidental nature of their correct belief. If we say they have knowledge, the fortuitous nature seems to conflict with that claim. If we say they do not, the sufficiency of evidence appears violated.**
