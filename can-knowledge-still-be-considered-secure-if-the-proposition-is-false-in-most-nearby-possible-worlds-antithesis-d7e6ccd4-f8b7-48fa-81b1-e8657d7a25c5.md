## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition because of a reliable source in this world. In most nearby possible worlds, the source is unreliable, leading to a false proposition. Intuitively, it seems that the person lacks knowledge in such circumstances.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a proposition is false in most nearby possible worlds, then the belief in that proposition is insecure. This principle implies that knowledge requires more than just the proposition being true in a few nearby possible worlds.**
