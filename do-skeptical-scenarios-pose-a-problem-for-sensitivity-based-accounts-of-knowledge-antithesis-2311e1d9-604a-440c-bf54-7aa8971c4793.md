## Content

**Consider a thought experiment involving skeptical scenarios, such as the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis, where an individual believes they are experiencing reality as it seems but in fact, all experiences are generated by a computer. If the proposition "I am in a room with a chair" were false (because one is a brain in a vat), the person would still believe it, indicating insensitivity. Intuitively, the skeptical scenarios cast doubt on ordinary knowledge claims, yet we often regard such beliefs in normal conditions as knowledge.**, **The principle of sensitivity might be taken to imply that ordinary knowledge claims are ill-founded because they cannot exclude skeptical scenarios, thereby forcing us to reconsider our everyday understanding of knowledge.**
