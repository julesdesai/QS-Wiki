## Content

**Consider a scenario where a subject learns a widely accepted scientific fact directly from an authoritative figure, yet in a hypothetical world where the figure misleads, the subject would still believe it. Intuitively, the person seems to know the fact due to its authority, challenging the necessity of sensitivity.**, **It is implausible to demand sensitivity for knowledge when the belief is rooted in an authoritative or widespread consensus.**
