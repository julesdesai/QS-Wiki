## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a true belief based on reliable perceptions in normal contexts, yet these perceptions would mislead them in highly atypical worlds. Intuitively, the person seems to have knowledge in the normal context but not in the atypical one, challenging the necessity of sensitivity across all contexts.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should remain consistent across normal contexts and not be eroded by highly variable or atypical scenarios.**
