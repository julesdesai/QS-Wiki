## Content

**Consider a scenario where each link in an infinite justification chain provides causal support to the next. Intuitively, it seems unlikely that causal relationships can consistently hold across infinite contexts without weakening or transforming in unexpected ways.**, **There is a plausible principle that causal connections degrade over time or distance. This principle together with the notion of an infinite causal chain means that after a certain point, earlier causal influences would dissipate, undermining the consistency of justification.**
