## Content

**Consider a person who believes a scientific theory based on current evidence but remains open to changing this belief if future research disproves it.**, **Sensitivity holds that one should not believe if the proposition were false, conflicting with the idea that beliefs can be held validly until disproved, suggesting true beliefs are not necessarily stable under hypothetical falsity.**
