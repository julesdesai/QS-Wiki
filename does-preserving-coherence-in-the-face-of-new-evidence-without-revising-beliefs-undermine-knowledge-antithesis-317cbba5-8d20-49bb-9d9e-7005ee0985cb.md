## Content

**Imagine a person who receives new evidence that contradicts their current belief system but chooses to ignore it to maintain coherence. Intuitively, this choice seems to undermine the claim to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires updating beliefs in light of new evidence. This principle implies that coherence should not be preserved at the cost of excluding relevant evidence.**
