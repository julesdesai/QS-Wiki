## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition P, and P logically entails another proposition Q, then the person should know Q as well.**, **Consider a case where person B knows P in a context but does not meet the epistemic standards required for Q in the same context. This seems to violate the closure principle, which is counterintuitive.**
