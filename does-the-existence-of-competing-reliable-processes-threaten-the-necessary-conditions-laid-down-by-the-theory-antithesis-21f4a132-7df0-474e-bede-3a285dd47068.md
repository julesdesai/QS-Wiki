## Content

**There is a plausible principle that only one process can be the most reliable in a given situation. This principle together with the multiplicity of processes entails that different reliable processes can lead to conflicting true beliefs.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be obtained if reliable processes produce conflicting beliefs about the same proposition.**
