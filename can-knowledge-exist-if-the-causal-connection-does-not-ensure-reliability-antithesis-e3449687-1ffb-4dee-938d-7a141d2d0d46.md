## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a personâ€™s belief is causally connected to the fact but through an unreliable source that only occasionally yields the truth. Intuitively, we have to say that the belief does not count as knowledge despite the causal connection.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires reliability of the process producing the belief. This principle, together with the occasional unreliability, entails lacking knowledge.**
