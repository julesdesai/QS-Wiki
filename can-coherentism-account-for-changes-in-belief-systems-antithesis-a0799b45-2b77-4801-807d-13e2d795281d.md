## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a personâ€™s belief system dramatically changes when exposed to new evidence, altering what coheres. If they "knew" a proposition before this change, intuitively they should adjust their knowledge claim.**, **It is implausible for knowledge to remain stable under coherentist conditions when the coherence of beliefs can drastically change with updated information.**
