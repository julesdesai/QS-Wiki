## Content

**A scenario in which a person with properly functioning cognitive faculties forms a belief that is true by sheer luck might still not qualify as knowledge.**, **It is implausible to assert that proper function alone eliminates instances of epistemic luck influencing belief accuracy.**, **Suppose we have a case where a belief arising through a close encounter with error, yet true, still intuitively lacks the stability of knowledge despite proper cognitive functioning.**
