## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes correctly that the bridge they cross is safe based on inspections and reports. Unbeknownst to them, it has secretly incurred damage and any use now is perilous, but it remains intact through sheer luck whenever they cross it. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge about the safety of the bridge due to this unknown factor despite having a true belief at the time of use.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge attribution should not depend entirely on unknown external factors, as this could imply that all practical knowledge of everyday safety is suspect and contingent.**
