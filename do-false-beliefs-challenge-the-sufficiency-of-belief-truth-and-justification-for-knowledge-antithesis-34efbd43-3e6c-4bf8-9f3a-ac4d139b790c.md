## Content

**Consider a scenario in which Lisa believes a proposition based on incorrect supporting evidence, like "The chemical is harmless" based on a misread report, but it is true for unrelated reasons. Intuitively, we would judge that Lisa does not know the chemical is harmless.**, **For knowledge, it is implausible that one can have a justified belief that is true purely by chance from incorrect evidence.**
