## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a true belief that tracks the truth but also holds another related false belief that does not track the truth. In such a scenario, intuitively we may question the validity of the knowledge claim for the true belief.**, **It is implausible that isolated truth-tracking of one belief while ignoring related errors should constitute knowledge.**
