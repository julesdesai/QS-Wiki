## Content

**Consider a case in which a person believes their plant is dying because its leaves are yellowing, which is true. However, the yellowness is due to the lighting in the room, not the plant's health. The belief that the plant is dying is true due to a hidden pest issue. Intuitively, such masking of cause affects the judgment of knowledge**, **The causal connection may be broken by irrelevant causative details, questioning whether the established connection between fact and belief is sufficiently appropriate to account for genuine knowledge**
