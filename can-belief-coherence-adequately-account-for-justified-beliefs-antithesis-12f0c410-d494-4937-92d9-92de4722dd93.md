## Content

**Coherence with a system of beliefs does not necessarily ensure the justification of each individual belief within that system.**, **Consider a person who holds a coherent set of beliefs, some of which are formed through mere speculation or guessing, these beliefs might not have genuine justification despite cohering.**, **If coherence is taken as sufficient for knowledge, then even unjustified but coherent speculative beliefs would be considered knowledge, which seems counterintuitive.**
