## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a cognitive process is reliable in one context but unreliable in another context. It is implausible that a process can be universally defined as reliable if it varies with context.**, **Consider a situation where a process's reliability varies significantly between contexts, any robust definition of reliability must take contextual variation into account when assigning knowledge.**
