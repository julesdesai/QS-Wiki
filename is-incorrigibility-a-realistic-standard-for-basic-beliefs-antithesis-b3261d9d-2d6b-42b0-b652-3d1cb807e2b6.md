## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone cannot be convinced otherwise about a belief, like an irrational fear, even when it's not true. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would not concur that their belief is incorrigible in a knowledge-promoting sense.**, **There is a plausible principle that being unable to be challenged does not equate to correctness. This principle implies that incorrigibility alone doesnâ€™t ensure the truth of basic beliefs.**
