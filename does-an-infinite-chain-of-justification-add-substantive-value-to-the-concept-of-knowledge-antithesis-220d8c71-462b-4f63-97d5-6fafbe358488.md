## Content

**Suppose a person has an infinitely long non-repeating chain of justification for a belief that "water boils at 100Â°C at sea level."**, **In this case, intuitively the infinite chain does not seem to enhance our understanding or confidence in this known fact compared to a finite, cogent explanation.**, **An infinite chain of justification might not substantively contribute to the value of the knowledge, which questions its necessity.**
