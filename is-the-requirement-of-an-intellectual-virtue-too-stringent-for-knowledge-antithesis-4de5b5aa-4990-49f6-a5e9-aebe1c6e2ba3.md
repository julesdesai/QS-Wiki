## Content

**Suppose a case in which a person has a true and justified belief based on careful and reasonable deliberation, but due to their lack of an intellectual virtue, such as tenacity, they abandon the belief in the face of pressure. Intuitively, we would still say that their belief was knowledge before they gave it up.**, **Imagine a situation in which someone achieves a true belief through the use of effective critical thinking skills, which are not easily categorized as intellectual virtues. Intuitively, it seems plausible that this could still count as knowledge.**
