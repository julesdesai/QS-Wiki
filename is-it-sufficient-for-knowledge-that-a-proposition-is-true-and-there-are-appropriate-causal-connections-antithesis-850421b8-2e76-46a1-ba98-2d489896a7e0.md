## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone stumbles upon a correct answer in a quiz by sheer luck, having heard it in a song they cannot recall. In this case, intuitively we would not say they know the proposition, despite its truth and a possible causal link.**, **There is a plausible principle that mere truth and causal connection are insufficient without understanding or awareness.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be reduced to simple truth and causal association, as knowledge traditionally implies a deeper recognition or understanding by the knower.**
