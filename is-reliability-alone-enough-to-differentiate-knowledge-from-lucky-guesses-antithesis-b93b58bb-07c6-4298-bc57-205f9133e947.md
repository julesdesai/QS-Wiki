## Content

**The reliability of a process does not preclude the possibility of a belief being a lucky guess rather than genuine knowledge.**, **Suppose a person believes a true proposition through a process that typically works reliably but it was a guess in this instance. Intuitively, we hesitate to call this knowledge since it was a guess despite being true through a reliable process.**
