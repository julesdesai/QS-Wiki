## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which individuals in different contexts claim to share knowledge about the same historical event.**, **Intuitively, shared knowledge requires that the same standards apply across contexts to maintain consistency in truth and belief.**, **If contextualism permits varying standards across contexts, it is unclear how shared knowledge can exist consistently, as the requirements for knowledge may differ too greatly.**
