## Content

**There is a plausible principle that truth and usefulness can exist without acceptance, such as scientific facts leveraged by those unaware. This principle questions how necessity ties these elements intrinsically for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a researcher inadvertently discovers a truthful and useful fact through irrelevant experiments. Intuitively, knowledge requires recognition and intentional acceptance beyond incidental discovery.**
