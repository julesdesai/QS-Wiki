## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true**, **Causal networks are linear, avoiding circularity by tracing back to an initial, linear cause**
