## Content

**Reliabilism posits that a true belief resulting from a reliable process constitutes knowledge.**, **Imagine a case where a person forms a belief through a reliable process but the truth of the belief is actually due to an element of luck, such as guessing the winner of a horse race correctly against improbable odds.**, **Intuitively, we would find it implausible to count such a belief as knowledge because the truth was not genuinely secured by the reliability of the process.**
