## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should have jointly necessary and sufficient conditions.**, **Reliabilism posits that reliability is a necessary and sufficient condition for knowledge along with truth and belief.**, **A person may have a reliably formed true belief yet intuitively lack knowledge if other necessary epistemic elements such as degree of understanding are absent.**
