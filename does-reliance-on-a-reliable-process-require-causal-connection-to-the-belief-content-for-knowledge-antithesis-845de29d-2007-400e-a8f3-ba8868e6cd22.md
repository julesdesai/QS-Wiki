## Content

**Consider a student who reliably knows their exam grades because of leaks that coincidentally match the real results every time, and not through their actual exam performance feedback. Intuitively, the student does not have true knowledge of their performance.**, **A reliable process forming a belief should have a causal or explanatory connection to the truth content to qualify as producing knowledge.**
