## Content

**Suppose a person correctly predicts the outcome of a random event, such as a coin toss, based on a guess. Despite the correct prediction, intuitively, we would not judge that the person possesses knowledge about the outcome.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a belief is formed in a way that could easily have led to a false conclusion, then the absence of significant luck is violated. This principle together with the requirement for knowledge suggests that epistemic luck is always significant when it comes to knowledge.**
