## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual's belief about an event is influenced by an incorrect prophecy but coincidentally aligns with the true outcome of the event. Despite the belief not being inferred from any falsehood, intuitively, the reliance on an unreliable source suggests a lack of knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that for a belief to count as knowledge, its source must be reliable or credible. A lack of such credibility undermines the idea of the belief constituting knowledge.**
