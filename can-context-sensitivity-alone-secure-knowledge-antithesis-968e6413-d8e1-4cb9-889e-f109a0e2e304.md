## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge ought to be stable across different contexts. This principle together with context sensitivity suggests that what is known could vary greatly between contexts.**, **In a case where different people are assessing the same proposition under different contexts, intuitively, it seems problematic that one might know the proposition while another may not, solely due to differing contextual standards.**
