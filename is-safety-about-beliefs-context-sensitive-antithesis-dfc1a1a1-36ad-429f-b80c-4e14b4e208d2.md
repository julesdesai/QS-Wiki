## Content

**Consider a scenario where the similarity of circumstances in which a belief holds safely varies according to context. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the safety condition might be satisfied in one context but not in another.**, **There is a plausible principle that if the satisfaction of a knowledge condition like safety varies with context, then the condition cannot robustly guarantee knowledge. This principle together with the observation of context sensitivity challenges the sufficiency of the safety condition for knowledge.**
