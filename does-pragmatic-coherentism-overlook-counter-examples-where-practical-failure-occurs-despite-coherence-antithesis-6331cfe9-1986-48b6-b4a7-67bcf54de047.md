## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a set of beliefs that are coherent and true, but a particular action based on these beliefs leads to practical failure. Intuitively, this suggests that coherence and successful engagement are not correlated in this instance, challenging the sufficiency of coherence for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a connection to truth that ensures not just practical success but also predictability and reliability, which may be absent in solely coherent belief systems.**
