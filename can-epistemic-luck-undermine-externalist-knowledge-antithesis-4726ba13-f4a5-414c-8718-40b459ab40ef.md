## Content

**Imagine a situation in which a person forms a true belief based on conditions external to their awareness, such as an unreliable source that coincidentally happens to be correct in this instance. Intuitively, it seems that such a belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible to consider a belief as knowledge if its truth results merely from luck, even when externalist conditions, such as reliability, are met.**
