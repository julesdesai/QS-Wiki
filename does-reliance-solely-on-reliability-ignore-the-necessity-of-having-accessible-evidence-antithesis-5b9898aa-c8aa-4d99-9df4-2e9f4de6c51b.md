## Content

**Suppose Emma trusts a computer's output for diagnosing illnesses, knowing it uses complex algorithms to form accurate conclusions.**, **She believes the diagnosis is true based solely on the machineâ€™s reliability without understanding how it derived this result.**, **Intuitively, lacking access to the evidence or understanding undermines our sense that Emma has knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of mere reliability.**
