## Content

**Suppose a person holds a belief with fallible justification, unaware of existing but undiscovered evidence that contradicts the belief. Intuitively, one might argue that if such counter-evidence exists, the person does not possess knowledge.**, **When justification fails to consider all potential evidence, it cannot reliably make a proposition true, thus failing in its purpose of supporting knowledge.**
