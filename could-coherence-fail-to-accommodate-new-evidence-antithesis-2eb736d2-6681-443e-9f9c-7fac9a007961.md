## Content

**Suppose a person receives new, credible evidence that conflicts with their current coherent belief system.**, **Intuitively, we would say that if they ignore the new evidence to maintain coherence, they might not possess genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be responsive to new information, not rigidly bound by coherence alone.**
