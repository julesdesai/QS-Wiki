## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a necessary truth, such as a basic arithmetic fact. In such cases, it seems implausible to apply the sensitivity condition, as the truth cannot be false.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge of necessary truths must be addressed differently because their truth is not contingent on the worldâ€™s state. This principle suggests sensitivity is irrelevant for necessary truths.**, **Knowledge of necessary truths challenges the concept of sensitivity, as it hinges on understanding rather than counterfactual considerations of falsehood.**
