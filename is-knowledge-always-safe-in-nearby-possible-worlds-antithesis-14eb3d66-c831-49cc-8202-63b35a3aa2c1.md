## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition on flimsy evidence, and by luck, this proposition ends up being true in the actual world. Intuitively, we might judge that this person does not have knowledge despite the proposition being true.**, **In nearby possible worlds where slight variations occur, the same belief held on the same flimsy evidence results in a false proposition, thus challenging the idea that nearby worlds affirm the belief consistently.**
