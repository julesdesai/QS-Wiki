## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence, yet there are many unrelated alternative possibilities they cannot rule out. Intuitively, it seems they could still be said to have knowledge despite these alternatives**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires ruling out only relevant alternatives. This principle together with the assertion that unrelated possibilities can also prevent knowledge suggests a conflict**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires ruling out every possible alternative, even those unrelated**
