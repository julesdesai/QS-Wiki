## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which humans successfully navigate and learn an alien environment using randomly developed survival techniques. Intuitively, successful navigation and communication in such an environment seem like genuine knowledge.**, **A sufficiently understanding and adaptive response in an unsuitable environment suggests that the notion of an environment suiting the design plan is overly restrictive for knowledge.**
