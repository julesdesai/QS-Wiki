## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person gains knowledge through testimony from a highly credible expert. Intuitively, we would say this person knows the proposition based on the expert's testimony.**, **It is implausible that this knowledge rests on basic beliefs that are self-evident or incorrigible because testimonial knowledge relies on trust and external validation rather than self-evidence or incorrigibility.**
