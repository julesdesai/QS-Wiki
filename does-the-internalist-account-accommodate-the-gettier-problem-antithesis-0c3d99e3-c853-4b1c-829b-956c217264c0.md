## Content

**A case in which a person believes a proposition based on justified true belief but where the truth of the belief is due to coincidence is not a case in which the person truly knows the proposition.**, **For example, suppose a person is informed by an unreliable source that the office clock shows the correct time at noon, and coincidentally their justified belief happens to be true. Intuitively, this seems like a case of knowledge-luck rather than genuine knowledge.**
