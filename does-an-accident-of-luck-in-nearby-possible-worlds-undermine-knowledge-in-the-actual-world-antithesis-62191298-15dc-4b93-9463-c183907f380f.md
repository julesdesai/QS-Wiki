## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition, but in a majority of nearby possible worlds, the truth of that proposition is a matter of luck. Intuitively, this suggests that the person does not know that proposition, as knowledge should be more stable than luck allows.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be based on mere accident or luck in nearby possible worlds.**
