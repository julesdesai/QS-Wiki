## Content

**There is a plausible principle that having good evidence increases the likelihood of possessing knowledge. This principle together with cases of evidence leading to true beliefs accidentally (such as believing there is a tree outside because you see a reflection of a tree elsewhere rather than seeing the tree itself) suggests that the belief is not knowledge.**, **Consider a situation in which someone bases a belief about a time on a broken clock that luckily shows the correct time when glanced at. Intuitively, despite having seeming evidence and a true belief, the person does not have knowledge.**
