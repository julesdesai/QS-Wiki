## Content

**Suppose we have a case where multiple credible experts, using the best available evidence, assert a scientific theory which is later disproven. Intuitively, it seems these experts knew the theory while holding it to be true.**, **It is implausible that a person’s knowledge can retroactively be considered “not knowledge” simply because new evidence debunks a previously accepted theory.**
