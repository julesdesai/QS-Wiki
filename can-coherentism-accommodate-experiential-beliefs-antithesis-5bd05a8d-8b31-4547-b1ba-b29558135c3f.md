## Content

**There is a plausible principle that some foundational beliefs arise directly from experience and do not require coherence with other beliefs. This principle together with the necessity of coherence for justification implies that coherentism struggles to account for basic experiential beliefs.**, **Consider a person who sees a red apple and forms the belief that there is a red apple. Intuitively, the belief derives its justification from the immediate experience rather than its coherence with other beliefs.**
