## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires counterfactual reliability, meaning the belief would not be held if it were false. However, counterfactual situations may not adequately capture all types of knowledge, such as moral or ethical knowledge, where belief doesn't necessarily change if the proposition is false.**, **Counterfactual scenarios cannot always appropriately apply to non-empirical knowledge, highlighting the sensitivity condition’s limitation for broader epistemic claims.**
