## Content

**Imagine person P has a network of beliefs about a fictional world without realizing the world is fictional. These beliefs are coherent and interconnected based on narratives from books and movies. Despite coherence and truth within the fiction, intuitively, P lacks knowledge of the real world.**, **A plausible principle is that coherence of reasons is not sufficient for knowledge of reality. This principle, along with the truth and justification of beliefs regarding fiction, still allows one to conclude that P lacks genuine knowledge.**
