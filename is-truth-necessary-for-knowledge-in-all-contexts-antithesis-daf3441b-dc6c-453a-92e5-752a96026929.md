## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientific community accepts a theory as 'effectively true' for all practical purposes, despite knowing it's an approximation. Intuitively, they seem to have knowledge of the theory, even though it is not strictly true.**, **There is a plausible principle that practical utility can sometimes suffice for epistemic justification, conflicting with the requirement of strict truth for knowledge.**
