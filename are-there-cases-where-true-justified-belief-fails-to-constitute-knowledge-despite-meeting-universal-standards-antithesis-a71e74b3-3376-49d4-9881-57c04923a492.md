## Content

**A case where lucky circumstances cause someone to believe a proposition that turns out to be true and meet universal justification standards challenges the notion that these are sufficient for knowledge. Intuitively, mere luck does not convert belief into knowledge.**, **A principle that genuine knowledge should be resilient against mere coincidences underscores the insufficiency of universal justification in some scenarios.**
