## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person trusts a source that is generally reliable, but in this instance, the source is mistaken and provides a false proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, the proposition must be true. This principle together with the acceptance of false propositions entails that the trust-based definition cannot account for cases where the source is wrong.**
