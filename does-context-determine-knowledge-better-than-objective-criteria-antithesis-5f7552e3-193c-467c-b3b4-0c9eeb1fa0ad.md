## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be assessed by objective criteria that are consistent, such as logical coherence or empirical evidence. If knowledge varies by context, this principle is challenged by subjective variations.**, **Consider a scenario where one person's knowledge depends on group consensus within their context, leading to the intuition that such knowledge may lack objective reliability.**
