## Content

**Consider a case where two people in the same context disagree about whether a certain proposition counts as known. Intuitively, if knowledge is contextual, both individuals should reach the same conclusion.**, **Disagreements about knowledge claims within the same context suggest that either the standards of knowledge are not as dependent on context as claimed, or that context itself is insufficient to determine knowledge.**
