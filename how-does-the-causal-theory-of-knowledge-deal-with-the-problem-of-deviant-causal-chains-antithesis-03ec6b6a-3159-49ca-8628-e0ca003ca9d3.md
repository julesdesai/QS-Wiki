## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's correct belief about ice causing a car crash is derived from seeing a distorted reflection that incorrectly suggests the crash happened due to icy conditions. Intuitively, the belief seems to lack knowledge due to the distorted causal pathway**, **Deviant causal chains, where the pathway from fact to belief is not straightforward or direct, problematize the notion of an appropriate causal connection in the causal theory of knowledge**
