## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on a finite series of increasingly reliable reasons. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the proposition.**, **The requirement for an infinite chain of reasons for knowledge seems excessively demanding and contrary to common practice where finite reasoning often suffices.**
