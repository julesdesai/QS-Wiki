## Content

**Suppose we have a person who believes a proposition due to an unconscious process, such as a hunch grounded in reliable subconscious processing. Intuitively, we would judge that the person cannot articulate the justification but still attains knowledge.**, **It is plausible to assert that justification must be accessible to the believer for it to contribute to knowledge. This principle suggests justification grounded only in subconscious processes cannot suffice for knowledge.**
