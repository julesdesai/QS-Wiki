## Content

**It is implausible that knowledge requires the absence of defeaters because knowledge seems possible even when a defeater is irrelevant or inconsequential.**, **Suppose a person believes a true proposition with justification, and there is a potential defeater that is baseless. The person's justified true belief could still be regarded as knowledge despite the presence of an irrelevant defeater.**
