## Content

**Suppose there is a belief that is true in a particular context due to its pragmatic alignment but becomes false when broader truths are considered, such as a simplified scientific model. Intuitively, this belief seems to toggle between truth and falsehood based on practical considerations.**, **The notion that a proposition must be true for it to be knowledge becomes problematic if pragmatic concerns can dictate what is considered true, as this could make truth contingent on, or relative to, practical applications, thereby blurring the essence of truth as an absolute condition for knowledge.**
