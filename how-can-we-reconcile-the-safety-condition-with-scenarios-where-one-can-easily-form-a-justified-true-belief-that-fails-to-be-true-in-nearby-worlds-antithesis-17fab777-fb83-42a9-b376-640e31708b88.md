## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on strong and justified evidence, and the belief is true, but in nearby possible worlds, small changes lead to false conclusions. Intuitively, it seems that the person's belief should not qualify as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a slight alteration in circumstances easily leads to falsehoods, the original belief was not robust enough to be considered knowledge.**
