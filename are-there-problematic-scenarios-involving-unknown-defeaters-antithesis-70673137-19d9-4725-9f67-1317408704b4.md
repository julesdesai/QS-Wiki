## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone knows a proposition based on strong evidence but is unaware of a potential defeater they cannot access. Intuitively, we might still say they know the proposition.**, **The presence of unknown defeaters suggests that the condition of no defeaters might be too strict for practical applications of knowledge.**
