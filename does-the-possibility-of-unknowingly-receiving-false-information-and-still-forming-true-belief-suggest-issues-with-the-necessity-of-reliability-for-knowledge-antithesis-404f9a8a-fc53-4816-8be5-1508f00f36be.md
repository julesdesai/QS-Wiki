## Content

**Consider a situation where a student receives incorrect mathematical information from a teacher but independently arrives at the correct answer through personal calculations. Intuitively, the student knows the correct answer.**, **Reliability, as necessary for knowledge, would imply the student's knowledge is compromised due to unreliable initial information sources.**, **It seems implausible to say the student lacks knowledge when they independently calculate correctly, thus challenging the necessity of reliability.**
