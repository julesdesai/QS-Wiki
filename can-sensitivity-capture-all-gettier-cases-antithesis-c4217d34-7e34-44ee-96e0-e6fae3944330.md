## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified true belief that results from a true description of an object, but due to misunderstanding or an unusual circumstance, their belief is true by chance. This is a classic case known as a Gettier problem. In such a scenario, intuitively we judge that the person does not truly have knowledge.**, **Gettier cases reveal that justified true beliefs can result from situations where accidental truths occur, showcasing that sensitivity alone might be insufficient to rule out these problematic instances.**
