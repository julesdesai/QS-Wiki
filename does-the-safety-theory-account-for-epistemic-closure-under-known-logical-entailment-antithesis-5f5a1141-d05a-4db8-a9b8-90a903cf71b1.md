**Suppose Kelly knows a complex mathematical truth, from which another known truth logically follows. Logically, if Kelly knows the first truth, she should know the following truth under epistemic closure.**, **Safety Theory may fail to justify why Kelly knows the following truth if the means by which she avoids easily believing falsehoods in different cases becomes complex or indirect, challenging closure principles.**
