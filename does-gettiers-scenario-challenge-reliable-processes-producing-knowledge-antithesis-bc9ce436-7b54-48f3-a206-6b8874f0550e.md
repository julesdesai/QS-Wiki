## Content

**Consider a case where a person deduces a true belief from a justified belief but through a misleading indicator, like a usually accurate clock that stopped exactly 24 hours ago. Despite the reliability of the clock in general, the specific belief is accidentally true. Intuitively, we would not regard this as genuine knowledge.**, **It is plausible that knowledge requires something more than just truth, justification, and reliable source; there might be an element of luck undermining the claim.**
