## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a lottery ticket holder believes they have lost the lottery before the draw because the odds are so low, and they indeed lose. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say the holder knows that they would lose.**, **It is implausible that this belief is based on basic beliefs that are self-evident or incorrigible. This suggests that foundationalism might exclude instances where beliefs are justified and true but do not align with foundational requirements.**
