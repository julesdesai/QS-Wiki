## Content

**Consider a person forming a belief based on the appearance of an animal at the zoo, where all the animals are convincingly fake except for the one they happen to see, which is real. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, even though their belief is true and formed by the same reliable process that previously tended to produce true beliefs.**, **In cases where environmental conditions introduce significant luck factors, a reliable process alone may not be sufficient for knowledge because truth results from accidental circumstances.**
