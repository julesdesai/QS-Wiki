## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition that is true, and the belief is formed by a reliable process, but the person has no understanding of how the process works. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not fully know the proposition because understanding plays a role in knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that understanding the process contributing to forming a belief is necessary for robust knowledge, not just the reliability of the process.**
