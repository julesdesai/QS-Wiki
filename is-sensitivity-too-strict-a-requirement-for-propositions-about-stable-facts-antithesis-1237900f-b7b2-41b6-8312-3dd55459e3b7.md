## Content

**Suppose a person believes a mathematical theorem is true after careful derivation. The belief remains true even if the derivation contained minor unnoticed errors that assume the theorem is true.**, **Here, the belief about the theorem is not sensitive to irrelevant small mistakes because its truth stems from an overarching immutable reality, not contingent derivations.**
