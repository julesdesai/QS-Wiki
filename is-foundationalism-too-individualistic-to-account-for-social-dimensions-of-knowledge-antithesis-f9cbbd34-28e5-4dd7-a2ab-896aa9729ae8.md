## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a community collectively validates a scientific theory through peer review and consensus. Intuitively, this shared belief constitutes knowledge, even if no single individual's foundational beliefs can justify it alone.**, **There is a principle that knowledge can arise from social processes and collective validation. This principle challenges the idea that only self-evident or basic beliefs can constitute justification.**
