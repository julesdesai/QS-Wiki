## Content

**Consider a situation where two people have the same belief, one justified in their context but not justified in the other's context. Intuitively, it seems problematic for a belief to be known only contingently based on context.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge, once attained, should be stable and not fluctuate with context changes.**, **Context-dependent justification challenges the notion of stable and enduring knowledge.**
