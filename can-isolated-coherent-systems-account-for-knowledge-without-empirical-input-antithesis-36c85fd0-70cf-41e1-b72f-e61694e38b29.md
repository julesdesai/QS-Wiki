## Content

**Coherent belief systems may form in isolation from empirical evidence or experience.**, **Suppose a thinker develops an internally consistent set of beliefs in a sensory deprivation scenario, having no empirical basis but remaining coherent within their own mind.**, **If coherence is sufficient for knowledge, then these isolated systems would count as knowledge, contradicting the importance of empirical input for many kinds of knowledge.**
