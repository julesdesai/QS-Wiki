## Content

**Consider a situation where a person, based on strong evidence, believes a proposition that turns out to be true due to an unforeseen coincidence, rather than the evidence itself. Intuitively, while the person has justified belief, they do not have knowledge because the truth of the belief is not appropriately linked to the justification offered.**, **Therefore, even with belief and context-appropriate justification, these cases fail to establish knowledge due to the lack of a reliable connection between justification and true belief.**
