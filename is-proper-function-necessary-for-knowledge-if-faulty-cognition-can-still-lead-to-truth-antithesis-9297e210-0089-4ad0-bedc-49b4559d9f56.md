## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief using cognitive faculties that are malfunctioning due to a temporary illness. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person still knows the proposition, despite the improper function of their faculties.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be attributed based on the overall reliability of belief formation processes, rather than solely on proper cognitive function. This principle, together with the existence of malfunctions that lead to truth, challenges the necessity of proper function for knowledge.**
