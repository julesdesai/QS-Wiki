## Content

**Suppose new evidence emerges making previously true beliefs seem false, intuitively, it appears knowledge was present despite the truth evolving, challenging the necessity of truth in knowledge continuously.**, **There is a scenario where scientists hold theories they reasonably believe to be true later proven false, which suggests knowledge might align more with justified belief rather than truth.**
