## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge depends on stable, objective criteria rather than varying contexts. This principle together with the assumption that knowledge should be universally applicable entails that contextualism fails to provide a stable account of knowledge.**, **It is implausible that simply changing the context of inquiry can affect whether someone knows something. If knowledge is subject to varying standards depending on context, it seems arbitrary rather than logical.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person knows a simple fact, such as "the sky is blue," in an ordinary context. Intuitively, it is implausible that in a different context with higher standards, the person no longer knows this basic fact. If knowledge varies across contexts for basic facts, then knowledge becomes incoherent and unreliable.**
