## Content

**Suppose a person has a belief that perfectly coheres within an interconnected system of beliefs without any contradiction.**, **Consider a scenario where the external support for the belief's truth is entirely coincidental and not causally connected to the belief being held.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite coherence and external support.**
