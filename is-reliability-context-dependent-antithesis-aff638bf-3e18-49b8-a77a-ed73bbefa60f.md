## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the reliability of a cognitive process can vary significantly across different contexts or environments. If the reliability of a process changes, but the truth of a proposition does not, intuitively one's claim to knowledge might be questioned.**, **If the variability of reliability affects the status of belief as knowledge, it suggests that reliability alone does not capture the full nature of knowing.**
