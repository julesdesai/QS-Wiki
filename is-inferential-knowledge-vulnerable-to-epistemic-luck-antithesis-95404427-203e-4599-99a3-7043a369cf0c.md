## Content

**Consider a case where George infers a true conclusion from a general principle he knows through faulty reasoning that coincidentally arrives at the truth. Intuitively, George does not possess knowledge of the conclusion.**, **A plausible principle is that valid reasoning is required for inferential knowledge, and that excluding epistemic luck alone cannot account for knowledge derived from inference.**
