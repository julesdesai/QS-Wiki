## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which Pat believes a mathematical truth based on a detailed logical proof, ensuring the truth of the belief. Intuitively, we would say Pat knows the mathematical truth.**, **If Patâ€™s belief in the mathematical truth could easily have been mistaken because of the complexity of the proof, then Pat does not meet the safety condition, yet intuitively, we still judge her to have knowledge.**
