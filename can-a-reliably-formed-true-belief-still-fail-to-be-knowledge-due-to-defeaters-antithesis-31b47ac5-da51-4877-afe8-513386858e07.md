**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes there is water in a glass, this belief is true, and the belief was formed by visually inspecting the glass, which is a reliable process.**, **In this scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know there is water in the glass if they are unaware that the glass is in a room full of deceptive holograms of glasses containing water.**
