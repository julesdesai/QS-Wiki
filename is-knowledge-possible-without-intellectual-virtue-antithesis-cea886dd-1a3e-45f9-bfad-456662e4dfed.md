## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person accurately guesses the correct answer on a multiple-choice test without using any intellectual virtues like reasoning or reflection. In this scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge despite having a true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable belief formation, even if accidental, should count as knowledge. This principle together with the fact that an accurate guess is not considered an exercise of intellectual virtue, challenges the necessity of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
