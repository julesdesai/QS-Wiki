## Content

**A scenario exists where a person forms a belief based on strong evidence, the belief is true, and yet intuitively we would not consider this knowledge if a defeater is discovered later.**, **There is a plausible principle that if new evidence undermines the justification for a belief, the belief should not be considered knowledge.**, **It is implausible to assert that knowledge remains intact when crushing counter-evidence arises after forming a belief.**
