## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person evaluates deceptive evidence with great skill, leading to a true belief, while surrounded by misleading evidence that seems highly convincing. Intuitively, it seems the person does not possess knowledge due to the misleading environment.**, **For knowledge to be present, it might be necessary that the broader environmental context does not predominantly suggest falsehoods, even if the formation process was competent and the belief true.**
