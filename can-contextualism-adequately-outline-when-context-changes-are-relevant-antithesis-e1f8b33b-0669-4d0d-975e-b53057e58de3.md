## Content

**Suppose a case in which a small, seemingly irrelevant change occurs in a context, leading to a significant reassessment of epistemic standards. Intuitively, not all changes should warrant a reconsideration of knowledge claims, yet this delineation is unclear in contextualism.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, often considered stable, should be subject to frequent reassessment due to minor contextual shifts.**
