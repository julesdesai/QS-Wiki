## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person's cognitive faculties are functioning properly, and they form a belief that aligns with their faculties' design plan. Nevertheless, the belief turns out to be false due to unforeseen external factors. Intuitively, this could mean proper functioning does not necessarily ensure truth.**, **It is implausible that the functioning of cognitive faculties, however proper, can always yield true beliefs because unpredictable or misleading external changes can affect belief accuracy.**
