## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief based on complex reasons they cannot consciously access. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still knows the proposition because the belief is true and justified.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be based on reasons not accessible to consciousness. This principle together with the requirement of accessible justification challenges the sufficiency of internalism for knowledge.**, **It is implausible to assert that people always have conscious access to the justification for their beliefs due to cognitive limitations, yet we do not usually doubt their knowledge claims.**
