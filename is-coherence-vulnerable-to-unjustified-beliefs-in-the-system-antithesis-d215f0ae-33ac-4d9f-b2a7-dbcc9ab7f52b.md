## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's belief is coherent within their system, but the system includes foundational unjustified beliefs. Intuitively, we are inclined to say that coherence built on an unjustified foundation cannot yield genuine knowledge.**, **It is implausible to hold that coherence alone sufficiently ensures knowledge when the coherence could be grounded on beliefs lacking justification.**
