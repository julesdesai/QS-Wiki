## Content

**Suppose a scientist believes a specific species is extinct based on a reliable database, but new evidence emerges suggesting sightings of the species. Intuitively, we would need to reassess knowledge of the extinction status in light of the new information.**, **There is a plausible principle that the adequacy of truth for practical purposes must remain revisable in light of new evidence. This principle, combined with the fixed notion of practical truth sufficiency, reveals potential inadequacies in knowledge claims.**
