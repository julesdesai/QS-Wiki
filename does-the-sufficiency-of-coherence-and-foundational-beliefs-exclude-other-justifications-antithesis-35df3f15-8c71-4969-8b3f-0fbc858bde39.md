## Content

**If coherence and foundational beliefs are both required and considered sufficient for knowledge, this may neglect other valid forms of justification.**, **Alternative justifications, such as testimonial or inferential knowledge, might not easily fit within a strict foundational-coherent framework.**, **A restrictive view on justifications may leave out certain widely accepted forms of knowledge acquisition not conforming to this theory.**
