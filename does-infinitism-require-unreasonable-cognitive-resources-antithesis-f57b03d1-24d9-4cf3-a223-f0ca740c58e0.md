## Content

**Suppose someone is required to justify a belief with an infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons. Intuitively, the cognitive resources required to engage in such infinite justification could be considered unreasonable for human beings.**, **There is a plausible principle that humans should not be cognitively overburdened in the process of seeking knowledge. This principle suggests that the infinite chain requirement may impose excessive demands on individuals.**
