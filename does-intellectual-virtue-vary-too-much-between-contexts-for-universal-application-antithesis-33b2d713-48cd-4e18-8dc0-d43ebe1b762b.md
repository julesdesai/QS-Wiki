## Content

**There is a plausible principle that concepts central to knowledge must apply uniformly across contexts for consistency. Intellectual virtue, as exercised in diverse scenarios, varies too significantly.**, **Suppose we have a case where intellectual virtue in different cultural or situational contexts produces differing outcomes for what is considered knowledge. It is implausible that such variability provides a stable basis for knowledge.**
