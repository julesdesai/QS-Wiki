## Content

**Suppose we have a case where the same belief is evaluated under different contextual standards by the same individual. Intuitively, either the belief satisfies the standards, or it doesnâ€™t across all contexts.**, **If we say the belief satisfies the knowledge standards in one context but not in another, it implies variable standards for a single belief, which challenges the cohesion of epistemic assessment.**
