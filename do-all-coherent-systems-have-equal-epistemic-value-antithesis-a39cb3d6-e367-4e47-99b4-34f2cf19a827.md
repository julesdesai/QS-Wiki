## Content

**Consider two scenarios: one where a detective, Donna, constructs a coherent belief system solving a murder based on robust evidence, and another where a novelist, Nora, fabricates a coherent story with equivalent complexity. Intuitively, we would judge that Donna's system has greater epistemic value and potential for knowledge than Nora's fictional account, even if both are coherent.**, **There is a plausible principle that epistemic value correlates with truth-conduciveness and reality engagement, which this coherence-based equivalency fails to uphold, suggesting coherence alone does not suffice for knowledge.**
