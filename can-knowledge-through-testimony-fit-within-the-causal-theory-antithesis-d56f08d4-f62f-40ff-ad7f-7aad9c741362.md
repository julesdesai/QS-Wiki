## Content

**A case in which a person learns a truth through the trustworthy testimony of a friend, such as being informed of a new scientific discovery accurately, intuitively generates the judgement that the person has knowledge.**, **The causal theory proposes that the individual must have a causal connection to the truth to possess knowledge. However, in testimony, the causal chain may not directly involve the individual and the factual occurrence, but rather a secondary party.**, **If knowledge via indirect testimonial chains is acknowledged as legitimate, this challenges the causal theoryâ€™s condition of direct causal connection between truth and belief.**
