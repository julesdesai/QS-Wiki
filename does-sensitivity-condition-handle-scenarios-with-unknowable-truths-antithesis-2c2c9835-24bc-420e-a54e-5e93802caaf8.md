## Content

**Consider a truth about the distant past that no information remains about, such as the existence of a particular tree. Intuitively, no person can know this truth because any belief in it would not be sensitive to the tree's actual non-existence.**, **If it is sufficient for knowledge that a person believes the proposition, the proposition is true, and is sensitive to its falsehood, unknowable truths challenge knowledge as sensitivity.**
