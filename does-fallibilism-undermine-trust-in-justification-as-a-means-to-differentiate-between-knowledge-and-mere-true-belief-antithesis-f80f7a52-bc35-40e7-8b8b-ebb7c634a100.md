## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be distinguishable from mere true belief by the degree and reliability of justification. Justifications under fallibilism might not always serve this distinguishing function due to the possibility of error.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has fallible justification for a belief that is true. In such a scenario, intuitively, their justification appears insufficiently reliable to warrant the label of knowledge.**
