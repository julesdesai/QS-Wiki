## Content

**Consider the proposition that mathematical truths, such as "2+2=4", hold necessarily**, **If "2+2=4" were false, it is not clear what belief the person would hold because such propositions cannot be false**, **The sensitivity condition struggles to address necessary truths because counterfactual situations cannot apply, suggesting a gap in its application to all knowledge**
