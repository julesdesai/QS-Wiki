## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual is in a sensory deprivation tank and forms a coherent system of beliefs entirely based on imagination. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the individual does not have knowledge of the outside world.**, **It is implausible that a belief system can be coherent and justified without empirical input, such as sensory data or experiences.**
