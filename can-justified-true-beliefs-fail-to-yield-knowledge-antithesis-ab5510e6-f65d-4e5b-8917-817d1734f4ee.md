## Content

**Consider a situation where Casey justifiably believes a barn is real based on observation. Unbeknownst to Casey, this area is a facade-rich environment, and the barn is the only real one among many false fronts. Intuitively, Caseyâ€™s justified true belief does not amount to knowledge due to lack of awareness of surrounding falsehoods.**, **This indicates that justified true belief might require more than causal connection to ensure knowledge, such as awareness of potential deception.**
