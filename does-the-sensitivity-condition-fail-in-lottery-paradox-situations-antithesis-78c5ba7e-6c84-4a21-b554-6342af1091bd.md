## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a single ticket in a large lottery and believes it will not win based on the overwhelming odds. Intuitively, this belief does not qualify as knowledge despite being sensitive to the truth, as it could easily be false if the ticket were winning.**, **It is necessary that if the sensitivity condition were met, then the belief would qualify as knowledge. However, there seems to be a conflict with our intuition about knowledge in cases like the lottery.**
