## Content

**Suppose a person believes a false proposition but integrates it into a coherent network of beliefs. Intuitively, this is not a case of knowledge since the proposition is false.**, **Consider a situation where a person holds a true belief that fits within a coherent network of beliefs formed through unreliable methods. Intuitively, such methods undermine justifiable belief, suggesting there is no knowledge.**
