## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is said to know something in one situation but, after a change in circumstances, is no longer considered knowledgeable even though the truth and belief have not changed.**, **This suggests that knowledge being sufficiently contextual might allow for too much fluctuation in what is known, challenging the sufficiency of these standards.**
