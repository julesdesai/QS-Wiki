## Content

**Consider a case in which a city council generates a report about water quality, based on multiple layers of data collection, analysis, and summary, which eventually leads a resident to believe correctly that the water is safe. The causal chain here is indirect and complex, challenging the requirement for knowledge to have a discernibly appropriate causal connection**, **When causal chains are this intricate and multifaceted, intuitively, they may not easily fit the criteria of an appropriate causal connection for knowledge**
