## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition that later turns out to be false, but acting on this belief leads to practically beneficial consequences. Intuitively, this scenario suggests that practical consequences or usefulness of a belief can exist even if the belief is false.**, **It might seem implausible that beliefs requiring truth for practical consequences are necessary for knowledge if false beliefs can also have practical outcomes.**
