## Content

**Imagine Jordan finds money on the street while believing he will find money there due to a false rumor. The belief is coincidentally true, and there may be a causal connection via action, but intuitively, Jordan doesn't have knowledge due to luck.**, **Epistemic luck, where truth arises from chance rather than reliable causation, might undermine claims that causal connection ensures knowledge.**
