## Content

**Suppose an individual recalls an event from their childhood accurately but later memories slightly alter the event details due to cognitive bias or fading memory. The factual basis may remain true, but due to memory distortion, the retained belief concerning details may be inaccurately interpreted, questioning knowledge status.**, **There is a plausible principle that accurate memory retention is necessary for non-accidentally true belief constituting knowledge. This principle suggests that memory distortions undermine belief authenticity, impacting whether it counts as knowledge.**
