## Content

**Suppose experts and laypeople differ significantly in their access to or evaluation of evidence. Intuitively, we ascribe knowledge differently to each.**, **The safety condition may equalize the assessment of expert and layperson beliefs when differentiating between reliability and error avoidance seems important.**, **If safety ignores the nuanced differences in expertise, it might not adequately reflect how knowledge is typically attributed across different levels of expertise.**
