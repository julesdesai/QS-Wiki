## Content

**Suppose a case where a person believes a proposition in a low-stakes context where little justification is needed for knowledge.**, **Suppose the same person is then placed in a high-stakes context where a higher standard of justification is needed for knowledge.**, **If context determines the standard of justification, it implies the person both knows and does not know the same proposition by meeting different standards.**, **It is implausible for one to simultaneously know and not know the same proposition based on context alone.**
