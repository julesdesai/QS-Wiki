## Content

**A traveler in an unfamiliar town asks locals for directions and relies on consistent information from several passersby to form beliefs about the local attractions. In this situation, the locals have given the correct details. However, the basis for this consistency arises purely from a recent and temporary community effort to promote tourism. The traveler's belief would not easily turn false in nearby possible situations, yielding a conclusion that the traveling scenario contains knowledge. Nonetheless, intuitively, this seems incorrect given the temporary and unusual nature of the reliability.**
