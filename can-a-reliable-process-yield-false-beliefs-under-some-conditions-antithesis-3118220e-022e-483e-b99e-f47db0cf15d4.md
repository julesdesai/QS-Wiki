## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a process can be generally reliable while producing specific false beliefs in certain situations.**, **If a process can lead to false beliefs occasionally, then merely relying on the reliability of a process may not be sufficient for claiming knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a process that usually leads to true beliefs but occasionally leads to false ones. If a belief formed by this process is false, intuitively, we would not say the person knows the false proposition.**
