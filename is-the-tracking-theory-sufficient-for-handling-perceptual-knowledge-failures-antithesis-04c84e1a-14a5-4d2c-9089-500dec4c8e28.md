## Content

**Consider an individual who, due to a visual illusion, falsely believes that a straight stick in the water is bent. Once the stick is removed, they regain their correct belief that it is straight. Intuitively, their knowledge seems affected by the perceptual scenario rather than a constant truth tracking.**, **Perceptual knowledge might fail even if belief seems to track truth in a typical situation since sensory misleading situations affect the reliability of tracking.**
