## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition based on a flimsy piece of evidence, yet in their relaxed context, this counts as justification. Intuitively, we have to say that they know the proposition.**, **If we say they do know, then knowledge standards become trivial and too easily met.**, **If we say they do not know, then we reject the sufficiency of context to define knowledge.**
