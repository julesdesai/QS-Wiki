## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alex, holds a ticket for a lottery that has a 1 in a million chance of winning. Intuitively, Alex does not know that his ticket will lose despite his strong statistical justification.**, **The principle that statistical justification alone can suffice for knowledge does not align with the intuitive claim that Alex lacks knowledge his ticket will lose in this case.**
