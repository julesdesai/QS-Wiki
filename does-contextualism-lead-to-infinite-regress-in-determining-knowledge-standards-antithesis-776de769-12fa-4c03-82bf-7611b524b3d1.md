## Content

**Consider a scenario where in each context, one needs to know the standards of that context to determine if one knows a proposition.**, **Intuitively, in order to know the standards in each context, one would need to know the standards for knowing those standards, leading to an infinite regress.**, **It is implausible that knowledge involves such an infinite regress, as it would make acquiring knowledge practically impossible.**
