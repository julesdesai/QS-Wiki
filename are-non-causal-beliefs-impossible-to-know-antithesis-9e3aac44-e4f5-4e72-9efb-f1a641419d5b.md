## Content

**Suppose a person knows an abstract concept that has no physical instantiation, thereby preventing any causal interaction. Intuitively, the person has knowledge despite the absence of causal connection.**, **There is a plausible principle that abstract beliefs need not be causally connected to the facts they represent. This principle suggests abstract knowledge can be independent of causal factors.**
