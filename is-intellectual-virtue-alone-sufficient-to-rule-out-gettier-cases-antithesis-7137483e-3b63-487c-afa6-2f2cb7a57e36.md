## Content

**Consider a Gettier-style scenario where a person forms a justified true belief through reliable processes, yet due to deceptive appearances, the belief was nearly false. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge despite their intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that any account of knowledge must explain what rules out Gettier cases. This principle together with the inherent ambiguity in intellectual virtue entails that additional conditions are required.**
