## Content

**Suppose there is a case where pragmatic usefulness of a proposition significantly alters the evaluation of its justification, such as a belief being more justified because it results in better practical decisions. In this scenario, it is intuitively challenging to separate the pragmatic effects from the justification itself.**, **If justification can be influenced by pragmatic factors, this implies that justification and pragmatic utility are interconnected. This is problematic if justification is solely required for knowledge independent of pragmatic considerations, since changes in pragmatic contexts would alter justification and thus the nature of knowledge.**
