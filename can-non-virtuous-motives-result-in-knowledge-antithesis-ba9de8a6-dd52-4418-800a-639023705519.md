## Content

**Suppose a person arrives at a true belief due to dubious motives, such as self-interest or malice, yet the belief is true. Intuitively, it seems possible to describe the person as possessing knowledge regardless of the non-virtuous motive.**, **It is implausible to demand that only intellectually virtuous motives result in knowledge, as real-world instances show knowledge arising from various motives.**
