## Content

**Intuitively, we might feel a disconnect when a person believes a true proposition through a process that seems unreliable or uncoherent.**, **Consider a case where a person arrives at a true belief through guessing or a random method, which would traditionally seem unreliable.**, **If our intuitions suggest that such a method undermines genuine knowledge, it questions the necessity of both coherence and reliability in isolation.**
