## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person Tom believes that he is watching a live musical performance on TV because his friend told him about it and he sees it on screen. Unbeknownst to Tom, the TV broadcast is a re-run. Intuitively, we either have to say that Tom knows he is watching a performance because he has justified true belief, or that he does not know because his justification is based on false premises. If we say he knows, then knowledge could be based on inaccurate information. If we say he does not know, then justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.**
