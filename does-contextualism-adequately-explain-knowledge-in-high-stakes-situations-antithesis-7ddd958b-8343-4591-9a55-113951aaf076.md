## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person must decide whether to invest their life savings based on a friendâ€™s assurance that a stock is a good investment. Intuitively, higher stakes should not lower the evidential burden on such knowledge claims.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge, particularly in high-stakes situations, requires robust evidence regardless of conversational context.**, **It is implausible that the stakes of a situation alone can dictate the epistemic standards for knowledge without undermining the rationale for trusting knowledge claims.**
