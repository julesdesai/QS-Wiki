## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a bird in their garden and forms the belief that it's a robin, not having any reason to suspect otherwise. In this scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the bird is a robin.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a person knows something, the justification for their belief should be appropriate to the context in which the belief is formed. In the context of seeing a common bird in familiar surroundings, demanding further elaborate justification seems implausible.**
