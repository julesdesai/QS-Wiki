**It is implausible that process reliability alone can account for all complexities of knowledge, as there may be types of knowledge requiring additional factors.**, **Consider a type of knowledge, like moral insights, which might rely on subjective, non-reliable processes more than objective reliability. Intuitively, we wouldn't base knowledge solely on objective reliability in such cases.**
