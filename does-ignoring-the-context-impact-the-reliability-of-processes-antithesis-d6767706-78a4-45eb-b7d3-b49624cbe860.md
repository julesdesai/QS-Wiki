## Content

**Consider a scenario where a cognitive process deemed reliable in one context is unreliable in another due to specific environmental factors. In this scenario, intuitively, a belief might be true and reliably formed in one context but not in another.**, **It is implausible that reliability can be context-independent, as environmental factors can alter process effectiveness.**
