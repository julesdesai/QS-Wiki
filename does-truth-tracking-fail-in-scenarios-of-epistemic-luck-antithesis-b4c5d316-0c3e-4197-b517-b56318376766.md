## Content

**Suppose a situation where someone correctly believes that a lottery ticket will lose because it is statistically unlikely to win, yet does so coincidentally. Intuitively, this belief doesn't track the truth due to its reliance on chance.**, **Epistemic luck implies that the belief does not rely on a stable method connected to the truth, which undermines truth-tracking.**
