## Content

**In everyday reasoning, people often rely on induction when predicting the future based on past events, like expecting the sun to rise tomorrow**, **In counterfactual situations where the sun might not rise, people would still maintain their belief due to past experience**, **If sensitivity required counterfactual disbelief, everyday inductive reasoning would fail to count as knowledge under this view**
