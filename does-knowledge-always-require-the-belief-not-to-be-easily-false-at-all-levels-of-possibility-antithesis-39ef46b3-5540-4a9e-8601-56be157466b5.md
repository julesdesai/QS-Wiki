## Content

**A plausible principle suggests a belief could be unsafe just one step away in a branch of possibilities, yet substantial in others. If Carla believes she finished a marathon knowing her path generally leads to the finish, but an unnoticed detour or injury could disrupt outcome, her belief isnâ€™t always easily false.**, **Overemphasizing the robustness against easy falsity overextends the requirement for safe belief, limiting knowledge in practical situations.**
