## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For the person to know a proposition based on direct evidence, it is necessary their belief aligns with probabilistic reasoning**, **For a person to know a proposition through a testimony, the requirement for probabilistic reasoning applies indirectly, via evaluation of the general reliability of the testimony-sourcing process**, **Knowledge by testimony is integrated into Bayesian framework through developed trust in testimonial reliability, rather than individual case-by-case probabilistic assessment**
