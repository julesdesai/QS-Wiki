## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition and has justification that purportedly forms an infinite chain. Intuitively, it seems implausible that human cognition can actually comprehend an infinite series with causal linkages.**, **It is implausible that any person could practically maintain an infinite chain of justification given cognitive and temporal limitations.**, **Suppose we have a case in which justification for a belief is presented as an infinite chain. Theoretically, a causal link between each successive reason would require a non-ending sequence of causes, leading to paradoxes similar to those in infinite regress.**
