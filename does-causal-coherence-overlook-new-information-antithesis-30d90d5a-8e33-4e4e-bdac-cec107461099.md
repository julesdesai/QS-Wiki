## Content

**Suppose a person P has a coherent set of beliefs established through reliable processes but is unaware of new, relevant information that contradicts these beliefs. Intuitively, P lacks knowledge if they fail to update their beliefs accordingly.**, **The reliance on coherence with existing beliefs may hinder the acquisition of knowledge when new, contradictory information is available.**
