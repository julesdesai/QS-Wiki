## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge, being objective, should not alter due to subjective contextual differences among individuals.**, **Suppose we have a case where two people in different conversational contexts learn the same true fact in an identical manner about a location, but the epistemic context varies due to different stakes. Intuitively, both seem to possess the same degree of knowledge despite contextual differences.**
