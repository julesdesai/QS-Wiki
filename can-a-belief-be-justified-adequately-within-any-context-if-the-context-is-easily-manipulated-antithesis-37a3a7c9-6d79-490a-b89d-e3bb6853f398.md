## Content

**Suppose a context is defined in such a way that minimal justification is deemed adequate for knowing a proposition, such as flipping a coin to determine the truth in trivial settings. Intuitively, this does not align with our understanding of what should be sufficient for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that just changing the context can lower the justification requirements to allow for knowledge.**
