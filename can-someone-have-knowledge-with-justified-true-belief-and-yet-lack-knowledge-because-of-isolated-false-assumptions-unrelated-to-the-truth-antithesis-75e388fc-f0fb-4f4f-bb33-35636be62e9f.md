## Content

**Imagine a case in which a scientist develops a correct theory based on a number of accurate data points and one incorrect assumption about an unrelated factor, like the historical accuracy of an unrelated event. Intuitively, we may find that the scientist still knows the theory to be correct despite the unrelated false assumption.**, **There is a principle suggesting that knowledge requires only the factors directly relevant to the truth be without falter, thereby challenging the idea that any false assumption precludes knowledge.**
