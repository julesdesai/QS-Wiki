## Content

**Consider cases of scientific paradigm shifts where foundational beliefs change radically, such as the shift from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics. Intuitively, we may judge that knowledge should accommodate such shifts without losing its foundational status.**, **It is implausible that foundationalism, tied strictly to one set of beliefs, can account for cases where contextual evolution or improvement in understanding occurs, thus failing to capture the dynamic nature of knowledge advancement.**
