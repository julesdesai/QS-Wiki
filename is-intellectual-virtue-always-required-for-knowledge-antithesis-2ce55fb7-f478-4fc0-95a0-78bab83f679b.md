## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone forms a true belief through sheer luck, such as guessing the outcome of a coin toss. Intuitively, we might judge that they do not know the outcome despite the belief being true.**, **There is a plausible principle that if knowledge requires intellectual virtue, then knowledge cannot arise merely from luck. This principle together with the scenario entails that knowledge is not simply about having a true belief.**
