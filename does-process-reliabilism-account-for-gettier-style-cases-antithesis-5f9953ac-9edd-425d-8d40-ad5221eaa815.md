## Content

**Consider a case where a person forms a belief that their colleague is in the office because they see their colleague's coat on the chair. Intuitively, we would judge that the belief is not knowledge if the colleague merely forgot the coat there the previous day and is not actually in the office.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief formed from a reliable process counts as knowledge. This principle together with a Gettier-style scenario in which a belief is formed through false assumptions entails that not all beliefs from reliable processes are knowledge.**
