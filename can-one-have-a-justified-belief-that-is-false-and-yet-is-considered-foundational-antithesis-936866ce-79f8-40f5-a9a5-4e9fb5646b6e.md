## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a belief as foundational that is false. Intuitively, either foundational beliefs can be false, or they cannot. If foundational beliefs can be false, then justification based on them can be flawed. If they cannot be false, then such a belief is not truly foundational.**
