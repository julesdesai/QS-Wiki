## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition due to compelling evidence rather than a direct causal connection to the fact itself. Intuitively we would still judge that the person knows the proposition based on the evidence alone.**, **Suppose a person accurately believes a proposition based on inferential evidence that is indirectly caused by the truth of the proposition. Intuitively, this seems sufficient for knowledge, even if the direct causal connection is lacking.**
