## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual is presented with overwhelming evidence for a proposition but maintains agnosticism and thus lacks belief. In such a scenario, intuitively we might still judge that they possess knowledge of the proposition despite lacking belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that holding compelling evidence could suffice for knowledge even absent explicit belief. This principle challenges the necessity of belief for knowledge within the view.**
