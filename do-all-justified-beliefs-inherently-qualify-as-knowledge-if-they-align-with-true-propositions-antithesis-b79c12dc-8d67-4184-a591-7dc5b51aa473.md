## Content

**Consider a situation where a person has a justified belief in a true proposition but lacks awareness of essential evidence due to a context. In such a situation, intuitively, the person may not possess genuine knowledge since their belief does not account for all the relevant information.**, **If knowledge is based merely on believing true propositions with contextual justification, there is a possibility that knowledge claims may exclude crucial evidence, thereby making the definition of knowledge questionable.**
