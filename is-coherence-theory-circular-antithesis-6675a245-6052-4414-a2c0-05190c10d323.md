## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for a theory to be explanatory, it must not rely on circular justification. Coherence theory requires beliefs to be justified by appealing to coherence within a network, which can be seen as a form of epistemic circularity.**, **It is implausible for a theory that employs circular reasoning to adequately explain the nature of knowledge without independent grounds.**
