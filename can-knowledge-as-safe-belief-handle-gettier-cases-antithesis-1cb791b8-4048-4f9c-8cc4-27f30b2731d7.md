## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, George, has a belief formed from seemingly reliable reasoning about time, believing it is noon based on a clock. This clock, however, is actually stopped, but coincidentally shows the correct time. Intuitively, even though George's belief is true and safely not false in nearby possible worlds, we would not say George knows it is noon.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to constitute knowledge, it should not just be true and safe, but also based on reliable evidence instead of mere coincidence. This principle together with the scenario entails that a belief being safely true is insufficient for knowledge if it is based on luck.**
