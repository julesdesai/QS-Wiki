**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition by sheer luck, such as winning a random lottery where failure was highly probable. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the result despite the belief being true.**, **A proposition can be true in nearly all nearby possible situations and still be based on unreliable grounds, which suggests that not all true beliefs according to the safety condition amount to knowledge.**
