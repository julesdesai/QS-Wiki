## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's everyday knowledge is challenged by a skeptical scenario, such as being a brain in a vat, and sensitivity demands non-belief if it were false. Intuition suggests they have knowledge in the face of such skepticism.**, **It is plausible that knowledge should withstand skeptical challenges without failing on sensitivity grounds.**
