## Content

**Consider a situation where complex systems like weather prediction are involved, and one believes a proposition based on sophisticated modeling yet can't rule out all potential relevant alternatives due to complexity. It seems intuitive that this still counts as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be practically applicable in real-world contexts, which challenges the ability of the view to account for complex environments where exhaustive ruling out of alternatives is impractical.**
