## Content

**Consider a case where Emily knows the proposition that whales are mammals based on a complex series of inferences from textbooks and biology classes rather than direct causal links from her observations. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that Emily knows the truth, even though her knowledge is mediated by indirect evidence and reasoning.**
