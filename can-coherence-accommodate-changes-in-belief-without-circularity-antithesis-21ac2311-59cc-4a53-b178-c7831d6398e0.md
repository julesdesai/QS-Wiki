## Content

**It is implausible that a coherent belief system can consistently adapt to new information without facing the problem of circularity or arbitrary adjustments to maintain coherence, as changes often require revising foundational premises.**, **Suppose we have a case in which someone's coherent belief system is challenged by new data that contradicts an accepted core belief. Intuitively, we either have to revise the core belief, risking inconsistency, or dismiss the data, leading to circular justification.**
