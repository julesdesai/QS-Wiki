## Content

**If knowledge requires infallible external justification, then any proposition vulnerable to potential future evidence cannot be known.**, **Most empirical propositions can always be called into question by new evidence, making them unknowable under this strict requirement.**, **This perspective leads to radical skepticism about knowledge of most, if not all, empirical propositions.**
