## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justified beliefs are not always safe beliefs.**, **Suppose someone forms a belief based on misleading evidence due to an incorrect but usually reliable scientific theory, yet the belief turns out to be true. In this scenario, intuitively, we might judge the belief as justified but not necessarily safe.**
