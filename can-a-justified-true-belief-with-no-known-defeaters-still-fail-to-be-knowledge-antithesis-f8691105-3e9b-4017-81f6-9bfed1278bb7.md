## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence, the proposition is true, and there are no defeaters present or known, yet the person is unknowingly lucky in their belief. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that this person lacks knowledge despite their belief being true and having no recognized defeaters.**
