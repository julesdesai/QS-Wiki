## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtue should lead reliably to truth. This principle together with the possibility of intellectual virtue leading to false beliefs suggests a conflict.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief using intellectual virtue but the belief is false. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **If intellectual virtue is supposed to guarantee knowledge, then it should not result in false beliefs. However, cases where intellectual virtue leads to false beliefs challenge this notion.**
