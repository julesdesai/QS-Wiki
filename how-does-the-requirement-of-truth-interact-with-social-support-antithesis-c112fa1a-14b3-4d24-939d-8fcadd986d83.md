## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a socially supported belief turns out to be false, but during the period of belief, the proposition was thought to be true. Intuitively, social support did not provide knowledge during that period.**, **The reliance on social support can fail when communities mistakenly support false beliefs, demonstrating that social support does not ensure truth or knowledge.**
