## Content

**Consider the case of a person who believes a proposition is true and finds it personally useful, but society views it as having no practical consequence.**, **Intuitively, we might judge that personal usefulness does not always make a belief or proposition knowledge. The societal disagreement on usefulness makes the condition too subjective to define knowledge universally.**
