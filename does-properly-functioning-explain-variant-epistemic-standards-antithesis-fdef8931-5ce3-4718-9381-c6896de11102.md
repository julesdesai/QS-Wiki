## Content

**Suppose a community has developed variant epistemic standards influencing their concept of truth due to unique environmental conditions. Intuitively, one may find their beliefs to still constitute knowledge despite differing standards.**, **A plausible consideration is that epistemic standards are flexible and allow for the possibility of knowledge without strict adherence to the notion of properly functioning faculties.**
