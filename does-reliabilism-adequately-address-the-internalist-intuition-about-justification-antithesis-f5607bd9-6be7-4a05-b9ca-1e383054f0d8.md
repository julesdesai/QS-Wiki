## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be justified, the believer should have access to reasons for their belief. Reliabilism focuses on external processes rather than the individual's access to reasons.**, **The external focus of reliabilism may conflict with the internalist intuition that justification requires some degree of reflective access, questioning its sufficiency in defining knowledge.**
