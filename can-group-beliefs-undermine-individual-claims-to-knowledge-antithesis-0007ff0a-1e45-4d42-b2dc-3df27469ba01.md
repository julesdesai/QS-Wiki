## Content

**Consider a situation where a group of people collectively hold beliefs which turn out to be true based entirely on the groupâ€™s expertise but individual members only know their specific part. Intuitively, one might think each individual doesn't have full knowledge of the collective conclusion.**, **This scenario questions if an individual's knowledge claims are sufficient if only their part is known with competence, troubling the notion of personal intellectual virtue or competence as necessary for the sufficiency of knowledge.**
