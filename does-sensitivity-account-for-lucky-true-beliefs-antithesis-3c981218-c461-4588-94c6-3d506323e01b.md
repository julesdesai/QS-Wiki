## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition correctly due to a lucky guess, and they would continue to believe it even if it were false due to arbitrary reasons. Intuitively, we would say they do not know, as their belief is correct merely by chance.**, **It is implausible to count such lucky true beliefs as knowledge, even if they are insensitive to the proposition's truth or falsity.**
