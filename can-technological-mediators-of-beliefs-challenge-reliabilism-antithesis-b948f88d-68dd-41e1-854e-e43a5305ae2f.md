## Content

**Suppose a person forms beliefs through a device that is typically reliable, but malfunctions unbeknownst to them, leading to a correct belief by coincidence. Intuitively, we might say that their resulting belief does not constitute knowledge, even though the belief is true.**, **It is implausible that technological intermediaries, subject to unseen failure, can ensure reliable belief formation sufficient for knowledge.**
