## Content

**Consider the case of a medical doctor who, based on current medical knowledge, believes a treatment is effective, but new research later disproves this. Intuitively, we might question whether the doctor ever truly had knowledge of the treatment's efficacy.**, **There is a plausible principle that changes in background information can retrospectively affect the validity of what was previously considered knowledge. This principle together with subsequent disproval of medical information entails that the justification for beliefs may shift with changes in background data, calling into question previous knowledge claims.**
