## Content

**Suppose a person holds a true belief justified by reliable external means, yet they would abandon this belief if presented with additional defeating evidence they currently lack. Intuitively, this seems questionable as true knowledge.**, **A sound principle suggests that genuine knowledge should be robust against possible defeating evidence, indicating that externalist conditions might overlook necessary considerations of defeasibility.**
