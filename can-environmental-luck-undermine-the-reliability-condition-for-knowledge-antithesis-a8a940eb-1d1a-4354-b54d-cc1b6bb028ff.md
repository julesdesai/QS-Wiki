## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition because of a reliable perception mechanism, the proposition is true, but the person is in an environment where their perception would usually be unreliable, yet coincidentally correct this time. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not really know the proposition.**, **It is plausible that if a knowledge claim is to be robust, the environment should not undermine the reliability of the process forming the belief. When environmental variability can affect the belief process, this casts doubt on merely reliable processes sufficing for knowledge.**
