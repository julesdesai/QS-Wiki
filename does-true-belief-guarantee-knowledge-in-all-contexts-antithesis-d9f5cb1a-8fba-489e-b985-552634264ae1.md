## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where someone believes a proposition based on religious faith, and the proposition happens to be true. Intuitively, we either have to say that this faith-based true belief is knowledge or it is not. If we say it is knowledge, then any true belief could count as knowledge irrespective of context. If we say it is not knowledge, then true belief does not universally guarantee knowledge.**
