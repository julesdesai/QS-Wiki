## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief through a process that is generally unreliable but, in a particular case, produces a true belief. Intuitively, we could argue that the person knows the proposition despite the unreliable and non-virtuous process.**, **It is implausible that every instance of knowledge must arise from intellectual virtue if some cases of true belief are produced by chance and still seem to qualify as knowledge.**
