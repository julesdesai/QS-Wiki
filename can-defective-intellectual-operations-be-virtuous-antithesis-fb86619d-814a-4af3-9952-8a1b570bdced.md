## Content

**Certain cognitive biases might lead someone to form a true belief, but these biases are not traditionally seen as intellectual virtues.**, **For example, if a person, due to pessimistic bias, accurately predicts negative outcomes, their correct belief doesn't arise from an intellectual virtue.**, **This shows that not every reliable trait resulting in true beliefs aligns with intellectual virtue, implying a mismatch between practical reliability and intellectual virtue.**
