## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a perceptual belief that seems self-evident but is later proven false due to a hallucination. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the belief was fallible.**, **There is a plausible principle that perceptual beliefs, which might appear self-evident, can be influenced by factors that render them fallible. This principle suggests that foundationalism's reliance on self-evidence may not guarantee infallibility in basic beliefs.**
