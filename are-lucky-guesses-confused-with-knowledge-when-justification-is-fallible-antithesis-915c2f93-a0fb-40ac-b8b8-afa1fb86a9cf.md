## Content

**Consider a case where a person makes a lucky guess that turns out to be true but is only supported by a weak justification. Intuitively, such a guess lacks knowledge because correct belief was coincidental rather than reasoned.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not depend on luck but should be a result of robust justification. Weak justification confuses lucky guesses with true knowledge.**
