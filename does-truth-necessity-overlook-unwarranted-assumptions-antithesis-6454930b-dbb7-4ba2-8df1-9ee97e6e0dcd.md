## Content

**Consider a case in which a person forms a belief based on reliable evidence pointing to false premises, yet by chance the belief turns out to be true. Intuitively, this does not count as knowledge.**, **Even if the proposition believed is true, if the path to belief includes faulty assumptions or reasoning, knowledge is not genuinely achieved.**, **For truth to contribute to knowledge, it should not arrive via accidental or flawed inferential routes.**
