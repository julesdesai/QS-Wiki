## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person justifiably believes a true proposition due to strong evidence but would continue to believe it even if it were false due to the deceptive nature of the evidence. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires a belief to be sensitive to the truth of a proposition, meaning that the belief would not persist if the proposition were false.**
