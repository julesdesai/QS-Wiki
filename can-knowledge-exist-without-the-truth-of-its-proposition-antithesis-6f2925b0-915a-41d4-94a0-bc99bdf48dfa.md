## Content

**Imagine a world where people have premonitory dreams that reliably predict future events, but the propositions dreamed are not themselves true yet predict true events. Intuitively, we might think they gain knowledge of the future despite the propositions not being presently true.**, **The principle that expected truth rather than present truth can suffice for knowledge suggests knowledge is not strictly tied to currently true propositions.**
