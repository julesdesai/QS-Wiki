## Content

**Suppose a person's belief in a proposition is true, and an external factor provides the justification, such as reliable testimony. Intuitively, we might judge the belief as not knowledge if the testimony happens to be coincidentally correct.**, **This intuition challenges the sufficiency of external conditions as justification without the knowerâ€™s awareness or understanding of the conditions.**
