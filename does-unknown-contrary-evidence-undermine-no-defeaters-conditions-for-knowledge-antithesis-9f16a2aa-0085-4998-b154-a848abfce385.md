## Content

**Suppose a scientist believes a theory based on extensive but ultimately incomplete data. Intuitively, given normal scientific trust, they appear to know the theory holds.**, **Imagine that unbeknownst to them, pending experimental results would falsify their theory, serving as undisclosed defeaters. The intuition is that they do not know the theory if contrary evidence exists.**, **Knowledge with no-defeaters stipulation may imply knowledge persists until explicit refutation, which diverges from the intuition that awaiting data impacts the confidence and status of scientific knowledge.**
