## Content

**Consider a scenario in which various cultures or academic disciplines have distinct definitions and applications for intellectual virtues. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge the notion of intellectual virtue becomes too fluid.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires stable and consistent criteria across instances. This principle together with variable applications of intellectual virtue shows instability as a criterion for knowledge.**
