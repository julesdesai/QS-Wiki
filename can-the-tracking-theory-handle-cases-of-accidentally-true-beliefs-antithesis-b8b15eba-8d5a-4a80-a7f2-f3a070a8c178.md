## Content

**Imagine a person who generally has unreliable cognitive abilities but forms a true belief by sheer luck about a complex mathematical theorem. Intuitively, we would hesitate to say that this person has knowledge of the theorem.**, **If a belief is only true by accident or luck, it is problematic to assert that the belief genuinely tracks the truth across possible situations.**
