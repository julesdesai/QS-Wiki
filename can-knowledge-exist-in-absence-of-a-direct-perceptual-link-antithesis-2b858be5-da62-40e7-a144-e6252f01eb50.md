## Content

**Suppose a case in which a person knows a complex scientific fact solely through testimony without any direct perceptual evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the absence of a direct causal perception does not inhibit their knowledge.**, **It is implausible to claim that knowledge can only arise from direct causal perception, as many forms of accepted knowledge come from testimonial and other indirect evidences without direct causation.**
