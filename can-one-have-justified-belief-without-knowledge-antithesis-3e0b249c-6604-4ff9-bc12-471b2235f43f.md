## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person believes that a bird is a cardinal because they heard someone say so. The belief could be justified if the speaker is an ornithologist.**, **Consider another situation where the person believes the same proposition because of a random guess. The belief may not be justified in this case.**, **Intuitively, the justified belief does not seem to constitute knowledge if the source of the justification is not reliable or stable.**
