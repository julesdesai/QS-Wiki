## Content

**Suppose an otherwise conducive environment, due to sudden chaos or unpredictability, makes true belief attainment fortuitous rather than reliable. Intuitively, we feel that this chaotic turn undermines the knowledge status traditionally lent by a competent process.**, **To preserve knowledge, it might be necessary that environmental conduciveness should be stable enough to convert competent and true beliefs into knowledge.**
