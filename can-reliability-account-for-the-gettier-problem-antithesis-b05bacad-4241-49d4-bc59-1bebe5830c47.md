## Content

**In a Gettier-type case, a person has a justified true belief through reliable processes, but due to an element of misfortune or error, the belief fails to be knowledge.**, **A reliable process can produce justified true beliefs in ordinary circumstances but may falter under atypical situations, revealing its limitations in securing knowledge.**, **To address Gettier problems, an additional condition is needed to account for cases where traditional criteria are met but knowledge is intuitively absent.**
