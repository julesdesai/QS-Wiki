## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes every true proposition and there are no defeaters to their beliefs, but they possess no understanding of the propositions or their interrelations. Intuitively, we might judge that the person lacks knowledge due to the absence of understanding.**, **There is a plausible principle that understanding is a crucial component of knowledge, not just the absence of defeaters.**
