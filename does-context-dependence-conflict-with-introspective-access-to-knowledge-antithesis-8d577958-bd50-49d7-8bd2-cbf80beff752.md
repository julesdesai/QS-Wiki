## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person claims to know they are in pain solely based on a specific context. Intuitively, knowing about one's own pain should not rely on external context, but rather on immediate introspective access.**, **A principle of introspective access to self-knowledge suggests that knowledge should be context-independent and directly accessible; if justification depends on context, it may complicate this introspective clarity.**
