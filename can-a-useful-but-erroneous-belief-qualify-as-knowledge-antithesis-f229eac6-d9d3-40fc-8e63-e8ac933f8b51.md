## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone accepts as true that a placebo will cure them and they do get better due to the placebo effect. Intuitively, we would say this acceptance is useful but not knowledge because the belief in the placebo's efficacy is false.**, **The concept of knowledge traditionally requires the truth of a proposition. This requirement means that practical usefulness does not suffice if the proposition is false.**
