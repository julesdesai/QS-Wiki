## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on current external evidence. Intuitively, if future evidence were to show their belief was based on faulty reasoning, we would not say they truly knew the proposition.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge is sensitive to new evidence, which means it should change if new, relevant evidence makes it likely false.**
