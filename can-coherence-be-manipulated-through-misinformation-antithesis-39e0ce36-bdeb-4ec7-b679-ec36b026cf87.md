**Suppose a person is subjected to a well-constructed but entirely misleading set of information that forms a coherent system of beliefs.**, **Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge to the person based on this coherence, as it is rooted in error.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires access to accurate, rather than misleading, information.**
