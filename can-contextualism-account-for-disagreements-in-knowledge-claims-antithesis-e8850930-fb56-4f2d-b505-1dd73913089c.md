## Content

**Suppose two individuals disagree about the knowledge status of a proposition due to different contextual justifications. Intuitively, their disagreement should be about the facts themselves, not merely about the context in which those facts are judged.**, **There is a plausible principle that disagreements about knowledge claims should be resolvable by appeal to objective criteria, not variable contextual standards, to maintain meaningful discourse.**
