## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if someone knows a proposition, then they must consistently track the truth of that proposition over time. This principle together with the idea that belief is intermittent challenges how one can maintain knowledge without constant re-evaluation.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition intermittently and only reaffirms it when external evidence re-emerges. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge during periods of non-belief.**
