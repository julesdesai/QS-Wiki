## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief based on strong inductive reasoning about a probabilistic event, like weather forecasting, and the belief turns out to be true. Intuitively, we might say they have knowledge but they might still hold the belief even if it were false, thus violating sensitivity.**, **The notion of probability can complicate the sensitivity requirement, suggesting that one might know something validly through probable reasoning without sensitivity being strictly met.**
