**Parent:** [Knowledge as Safety](knowledge-as-safety-synthesis-951b308a-d743-471e-b239-8d05feac0df2.md)

## Content

**A plausible principle is that the safety condition must account for the entire process of belief formation, not just the outcome. This principle together with complex chains of reasoning or faulty inferences entails difficulties for the sufficiency of nearby possible worlds as a standalone criterion.**
