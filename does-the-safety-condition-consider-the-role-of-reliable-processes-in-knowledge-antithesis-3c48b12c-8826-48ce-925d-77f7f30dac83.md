## Content

**Consider a person who always relies on an unreliable source for news but by coincidence, forms a true belief about an event. Intuitively, this does not amount to knowledge as the true belief formation is not based on a reliable method.**, **The Safety Condition might count this as knowledge because the belief accidentally meets the safety requirement, but it fails to consider the importance of reliability in knowledge.**
