## Content

**If knowledge is dependent on conversational context, then the knowledge of a scientific fact that requires rigorous proof in one context may not count as knowledge in a casual conversation context. Intuitively, this could undermine the objective nature of scientific or historical knowledge across different contexts.**, **A plausible principle says that scientific and factual knowledge should remain consistent regardless of conversational contexts, which challenges the variability allowed by contextualism.**
