## Content

**The closure principle states that if a person knows a proposition, and knows that this proposition entails another, then they know the other proposition as well.**, **If a person knows a proposition that entails a false proposition, the sensitivity condition might prevent them from knowing the consequence, undermining closure.**, **Suppose someone knows that they are in a room, and this entails there is a floor. If, counterfactually, there were no floor, there is a question about whether they know they are in a room.**
