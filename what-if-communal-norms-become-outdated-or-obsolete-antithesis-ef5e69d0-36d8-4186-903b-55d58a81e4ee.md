## Content

**Consider a scenario where communal epistemic norms fail to evolve with new evidence and persistently justify outdated beliefs. Intuitively, we might judge that a belief aligning with obsolete norms does not count as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that justifications should not solely rely on communal norms if they become outdated or fail to incorporate new evidence.**
