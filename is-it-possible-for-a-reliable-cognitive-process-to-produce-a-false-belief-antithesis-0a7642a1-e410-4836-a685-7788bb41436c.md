## Content

**Consider a cognitive process that typically produces true beliefs about the weather, but due to unusual atmospheric disturbances, it produces a false belief that it will rain tomorrow. Intuitively we would judge that the cognitive process is reliable even though it produced a false belief in this instance.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliability does not require infallibility, meaning a reliable process can lead to false beliefs in certain situations.**
