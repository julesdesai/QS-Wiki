## Content

**Suppose we have a case where context A accepts a belief as knowledge, but context B, with more stringent criteria, rejects it. Intuitively, it seems that knowledge should hold universally, and this discrepancy undermines that idea.**, **It is implausible that genuine knowledge can be so context-dependent that it fails to hold universally across varying contexts.**
