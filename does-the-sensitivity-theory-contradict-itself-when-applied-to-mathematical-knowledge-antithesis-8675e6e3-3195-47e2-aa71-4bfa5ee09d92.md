## Content

**In a case where a person knows a mathematical truth, such as "2+2=4," they believe it, it is true, and have justification.**, **Even if the proposition were false, the sensitivity condition suggests they should not believe it, which is logically impossible for necessary truths.**, **The sensitivity criterion could imply a contradiction when applied to necessary truths.**
