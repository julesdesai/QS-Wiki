## Content

**It is implausible that a process being reliable in producing true beliefs automatically entails that the beliefs formed through it are justified.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a reliable process is used, but the person has strong evidence that suggests the process is usually unreliable or misleading. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is not justified despite correctness or that justification requires more than reliability.**
