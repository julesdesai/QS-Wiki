## Content

**Consider that for every belief, it is possible to imagine some hypothetical defeater that might exist but is currently unknown. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that such imagined defeaters shouldn't threaten knowledge claims.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be resilient against the constraint of endless hypothetical defeaters. This principle together with requiring no defeaters entails that hardly any knowledge is secure.**
