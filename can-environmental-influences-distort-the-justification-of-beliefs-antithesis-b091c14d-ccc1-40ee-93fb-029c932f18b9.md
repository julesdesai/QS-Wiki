## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person in a politically biased environment believes a false news report, while their foundational beliefs are shaped by this environment. Intuitively, we might question whether the person truly knows the contents of the report.**, **There is a plausible principle that environmental factors can distort the justification of a belief. This principle together with the influence of a biased environment entails a challenge to the reliability of contextually justified beliefs as knowledge.**
