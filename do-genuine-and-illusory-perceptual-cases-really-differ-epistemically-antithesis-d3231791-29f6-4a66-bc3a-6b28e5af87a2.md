## Content

**Consider a situation where two people perceive an object, one under normal conditions, one under unusual conditions, yet both ascertain the same truth about the object. Intuitively, one might conclude that their epistemic status, leading to true belief, should be the same regardless of conditions.**, **An argument can be made that the reliability of perceptual conditions does not directly correlate to a necessarily different epistemic status for true beliefs formed.**
