## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through an unreliable cognitive process, but the belief happens to be true by chance. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that emphasizes the importance of the reliability of a cognitive process over the accidental truth of the belief. This principle, together with the scenario, entails that truth by chance is insufficient for knowledge.**
