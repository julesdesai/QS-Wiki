## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person memorizes a set of true historical facts that serve a practical purpose in quizzes but has no understanding of their historical significance. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not truly know these historical facts in a comprehensive sense.**, **It is implausible that practical consequences alone ensure genuine understanding, as understanding requires more than just practical application.**
