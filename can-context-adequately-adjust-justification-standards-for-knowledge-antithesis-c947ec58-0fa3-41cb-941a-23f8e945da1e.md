## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes they have seen a rare bird, their belief is true, and the context includes experts who set high justification standards. Intuitively, even if the person meets less rigorous standards in a non-expert context, they may not truly know the bird they saw if expert standards are not met.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires meeting a single, consistent standard of justification across contexts. If justification standards vary with context, this principle is challenged.**
