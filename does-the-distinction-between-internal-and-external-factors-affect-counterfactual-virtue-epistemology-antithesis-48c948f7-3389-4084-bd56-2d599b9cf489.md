## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is unaware of their own cognitive processes while forming a belief. Intuitively, we might find that the internal awareness of the process is irrelevant to the status of the belief as knowledge.**, **A case where a belief is true and formed from factors external to a person's awareness can still arise from intellectual virtue, raising questions about the necessity of internal factors.**, **A belief that counterfactually tracks the truth regardless of internal awareness challenges the necessity of internal factors for knowledge.**
