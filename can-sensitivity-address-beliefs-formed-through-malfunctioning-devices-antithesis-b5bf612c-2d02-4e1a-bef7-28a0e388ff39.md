## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition through a device that occasionally malfunctions but happens to provide the truth this time. Intuitively, belief through the device might not be recognized as knowledge.**, **The sensitivity criterion is violated since if the proposition were false, the malfunctioning device's behavior could still lead the person to believe it, reflecting insensitivity.**
