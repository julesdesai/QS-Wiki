## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Trent is in an environment with a trustworthy clock that is stopped at the correct time. Trent believes the time is noon because he sees the stopped clock indicating noon. In this scenario, the time is actually noon. Intuitively, Trent does not know the time, even though all conditions of the sensitivity theory are met.**, **For a person to know the time, it is necessary that his belief about the time is sensitive to the truth of the proposition. In the scenario with Trent and the stopped clock, the belief is true, but it would not differ even if the proposition were false.**
