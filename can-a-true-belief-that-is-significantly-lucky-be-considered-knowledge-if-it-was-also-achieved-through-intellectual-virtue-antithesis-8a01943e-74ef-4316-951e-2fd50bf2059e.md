## Content

**Suppose a student prepares thoroughly for an exam and forms a belief about a particular question's answer based on their preparation, yet the question happens to unusually match past papers they coincidentally reviewed. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is significantly lucky or that the student knows the answer. If we say the belief is significantly lucky, then intellectual virtue alone may not exclude significant luck from the formation of beliefs.**
