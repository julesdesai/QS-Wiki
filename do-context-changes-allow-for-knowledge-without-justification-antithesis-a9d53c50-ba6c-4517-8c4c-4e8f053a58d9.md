## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition that happens to be true due to context-sensitive conditions yet lacks justification for this belief.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge because epistemic justification seems necessary.**, **If knowledge were determined as sufficient solely based on belief, truth, and context-sensitive truth conditions, it may counteract the requirement of epistemic justification for knowledge.**
