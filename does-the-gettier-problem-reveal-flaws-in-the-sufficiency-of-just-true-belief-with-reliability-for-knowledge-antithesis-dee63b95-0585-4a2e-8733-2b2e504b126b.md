**Imagine a situation where person B believes their friend is in the office because their friend always works late. However, today their friend is there by coincidence. Intuitively, B does not know their friend is in the office.**, **Sufficiency claims that simultaneous truth, belief, and reliability would mean B knows, yet the intuition is that the belief is a lucky guess more than knowledge.**, **It appears implausible to attribute knowledge to beliefs formed with coincidental truth rather than genuine reliability, highlighting sufficiency condition issues.**
