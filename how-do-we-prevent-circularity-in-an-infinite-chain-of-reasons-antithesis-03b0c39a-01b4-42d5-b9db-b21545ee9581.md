## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone attempts to justify a belief with an infinite chain of reasons. Intuitively, we might be concerned about the possibility of the chain inadvertently looping back on itself, forming a circular justification that doesn't truly provide further validation for the belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that valid reasoning chains should avoid circularity to maintain genuine justification. This principle together with the need for infinite reasons suggests vigilance against potential loops within the chain.**
