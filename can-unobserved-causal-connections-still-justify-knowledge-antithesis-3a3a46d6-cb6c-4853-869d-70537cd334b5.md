## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a justified belief about a fact through indirect evidence, such as statistics, without directly observing the causal connections. In such a scenario, intuitively we might still say they have knowledge.**, **A plausible principle states that justification does not necessitate a direct causal pathway, allowing for knowledge through inferential methods.**, **It is implausible to suggest that all knowledge must rely on observable connections, as many scientific truths are accepted through indirect evidence and inference.**
