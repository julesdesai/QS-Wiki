## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition and knows that this proposition entails another proposition, then they should know the entailed proposition as well.**, **Nozickian tracking allows for scenarios where a person knows a proposition but not all of its consequences because some of the consequences might not satisfy the tracking conditions.**, **The rejection of knowledge closure principles challenges intuitive aspects of epistemic logic and common understanding of knowledge, suggesting a limitation of the Nozickian approach.**
