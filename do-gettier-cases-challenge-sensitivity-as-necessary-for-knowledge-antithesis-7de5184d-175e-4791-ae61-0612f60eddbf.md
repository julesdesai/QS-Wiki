## Content

**In a Gettier-style case, a person can hold a true belief justified by misleading evidence, lacking sensitivity because the belief would not be false in nearby possible worlds.**, **Intuitively, these scenarios challenge the notion that the person has knowledge, suggesting sensitivity might not capture all instances where knowledge is absent.**
