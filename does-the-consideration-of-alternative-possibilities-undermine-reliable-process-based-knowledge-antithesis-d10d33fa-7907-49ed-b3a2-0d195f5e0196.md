## Content

**Suppose one forms a belief through a reliable process but fails to consider closely relatable alternatives which also appear similarly justifiable. Intuitively, this constraint on alternative consideration incites doubts about whether the belief qualifies as knowledge.**, **The plausible principle entails that sufficient consideration of alternatives plays a key role in differentiating true knowledge from mere reliance on reliable process-driven true beliefs.**
