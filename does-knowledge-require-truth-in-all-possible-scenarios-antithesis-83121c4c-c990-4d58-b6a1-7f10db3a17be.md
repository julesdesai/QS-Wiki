## Content

**It is implausible that a proposition must be true in all scenarios for one to claim knowledge, as our understanding of truth can vary based on different contexts and interpretations.**, **Consider a situation where scientific consensus changes, causing previously accepted truths to be re-evaluated. Intuitively, we may still regard researchers as having known things based on the best available evidence, even if truths change.**
