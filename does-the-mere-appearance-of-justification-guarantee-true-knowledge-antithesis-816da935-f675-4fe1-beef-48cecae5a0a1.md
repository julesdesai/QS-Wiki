## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition, then their justification for believing the proposition must be based on reliable evidence.**, **It is possible for a person to have justification that appears sufficient upon introspection, but which is in fact based on unreliable sources such as misleading evidence or faulty reasoning.**, **Consider a scenario where a person introspectively believes they have strong justification for a belief, yet their "evidence" is a series of misleading testimonies. Intuitively, we would judge that this person lacks true knowledge.**
