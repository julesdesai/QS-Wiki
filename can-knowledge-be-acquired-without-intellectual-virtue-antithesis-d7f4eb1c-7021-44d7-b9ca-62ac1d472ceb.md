**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief about a proposition purely by chance. Intuitively, we would judge that person lacks knowledge of the proposition despite having a true belief.**, **It is plausible that a belief resulting from luck does not qualify as knowledge. This principle together implies that intellectual virtue may not be necessary for knowledge.**
