## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person predicts the outcome of a lottery using a complex mathematical method that is an intellectual virtue, and the prediction turns out to be true. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not know the outcome just because they used an intellectual virtue and arrived at the truth by chance.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than mere true belief arising from an intellectual virtue; it requires overcoming or ruling out relevant alternatives or luck.**
