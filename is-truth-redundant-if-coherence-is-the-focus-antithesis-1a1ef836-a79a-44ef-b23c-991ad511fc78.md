## Content

**If coherence alone is sufficient for knowledge, the role of truth as a separate requirement could be considered redundant.**, **Removing the necessity for truth in the definition of knowledge challenges the hybrid coherentist view, which specifies truth as necessary.**, **Imagine someone holding beliefs that are entirely coherent internally and externally within a virtual environment; without the criterion of truth, it is unclear whether this qualifies as knowledge.**
