## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Alex, accidentally finds a study guide that contains all the answers to an upcoming exam, and Alex uses this guide to perform well without understanding the material. Intuitively, we would judge that Alex's success in the exam was due to epistemic luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition entails understanding it and arriving at a justified belief without luck. This principle together with Alex's scenario suggests that having justified true belief without epistemic understanding still involves luck.**
