## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person receives information filtered through various social media echo chambers, biasing their virtues like diligence and curiosity. Intuitively, we would suspect such an environment could compromise the resulting beliefs' validity as knowledge.**
**Suppose we have a case in which beliefs are cultivated in informational silos, skewing how intellectual virtues apply and manifest. Such a case challenges consistent knowledge formation.**
**It is plausible that the structure of communication environments impedes intellectual virtues, indicating that virtue alone may not ensure reliable knowledge in biased settings.**
