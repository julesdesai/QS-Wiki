## Content

**Suppose we have two people, each with a reliable cognitive process leading them to contradictory beliefs on the same proposition, and each belief is considered true in its own system. Intuitively, both cannot have knowledge, which suggests reliability and truth alone are insufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that contradictory truths from reliable processes imply a failure in one process, challenging the sufficiency of reliability and truth for knowledge.**
