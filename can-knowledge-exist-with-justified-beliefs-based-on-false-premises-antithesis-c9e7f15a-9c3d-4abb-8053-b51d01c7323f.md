## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition because it is supported by strong evidence leading to a justified belief, but some of this evidence is unbeknownst to the person false. The belief in the proposition is true. The justification for the belief involves a false premise. Intuitively, the person still lacks knowledge because the justification involves false premises.**, **A situation where someone forms a true belief based on evidence that includes false premises raises doubt about claiming the person has knowledge because correctness of the belief seems accidental.**
