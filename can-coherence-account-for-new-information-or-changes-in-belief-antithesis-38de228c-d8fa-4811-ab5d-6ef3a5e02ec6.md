## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person encounters new evidence that contradicts their current coherent belief system but fails to integrate this evidence due to its lack of coherence. Intuitively, we would judge that the failure to accommodate true information suggests a deficiency in the coherence theory of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a theory of knowledge should account for the dynamic nature of belief and evidence, accommodating new truths without being confined by existing coherence, which the coherence view struggles with.**
