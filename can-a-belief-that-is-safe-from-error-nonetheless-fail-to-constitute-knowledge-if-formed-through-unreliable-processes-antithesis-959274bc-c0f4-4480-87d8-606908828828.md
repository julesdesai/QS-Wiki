## Content

**Consider a person whose belief is true, justified, and safe from error in nearby situations, but their belief results from a method known to be generally unreliable, like astrological readings.**, **Intuitively, even though the belief is safe from error, it seems inappropriate to classify it as knowledge due to the unreliable method of belief formation.**
