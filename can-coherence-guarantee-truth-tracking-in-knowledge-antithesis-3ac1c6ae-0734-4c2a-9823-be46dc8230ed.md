## Content

**Consider a scenario in which all of a personâ€™s beliefs are coherent but systematically detached from corresponding reality, like a well-constructed fiction. Intuitively, the person lacks knowledge due to this detachment.**, **It is implausible that mere coherence, without accounting for the reliability or truth-conduciveness of belief formation, ensures genuine knowledge.**
