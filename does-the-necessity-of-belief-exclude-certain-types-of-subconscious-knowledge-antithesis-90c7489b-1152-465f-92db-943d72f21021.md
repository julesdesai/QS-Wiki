## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person subconsciously knows a proposition but does not consciously believe it. Intuitively, we either have to say that subconscious knowledge is impossible or that conscious belief is not necessary for knowledge. If we say subconscious knowledge is impossible, then we reject many intuitive cases. If we say conscious belief is not necessary, then the necessity of belief as a criterion for knowledge is questionable.**
