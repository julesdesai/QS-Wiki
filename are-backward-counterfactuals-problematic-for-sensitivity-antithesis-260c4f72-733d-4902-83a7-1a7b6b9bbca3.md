## Content

**Consider an event where a person correctly believes it rained yesterday only via a weather app. Intuitively, this constitutes knowledge.**, **If yesterday's conditions were different, leading to no rain, the app wouldn't have updated, challenging intuitions because the current belief depends on past facts, not potential falsity.**
