## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, Pat, forms a belief about a particular event occurring due to receiving a forecast, while equally plausible contrary forecasts exist, all backed by justified reasoning processes. Intuitively, we either must say Pat knows the event will occur, or they do not. If we say Pat knows, despite the presence of equally plausible contrary beliefs, then knowledge appears too easily granted and influenced by luck. If we say Pat does not know, then justification may not suffice when multiple competing beliefs are justified.**
