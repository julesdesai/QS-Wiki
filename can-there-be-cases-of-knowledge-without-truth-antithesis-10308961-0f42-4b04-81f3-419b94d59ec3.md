## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a belief formed by intellectual virtue, but the belief corresponds to a false proposition due to unusual circumstances. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might struggle to deny that the person possesses some kind of epistemic credit akin to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that epistemic credit often attributed to knowledge should apply even in non-standard truth conditions, challenging the requirement that knowledge necessarily involves truth.**
