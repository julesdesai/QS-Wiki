## Content

**If justification varies widely across different contexts, then the same belief might count as knowledge in one context but not another. This variability could undermine the objectivity and universality that we typically associate with knowledge.**, **A principle asserts that what counts as justification should reliably lead a person to hold true beliefs across different situations. Variability in justification challenges this principle by suggesting that what is justified in one setting may not reliably lead to truth in another.**
