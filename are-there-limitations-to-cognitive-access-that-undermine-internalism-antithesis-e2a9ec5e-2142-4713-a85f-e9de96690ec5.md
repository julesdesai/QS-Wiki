## Content

**Cognitive science reveals cases where people hold justified beliefs based on unconscious processes that contribute to forming knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that due to cognitive limitations, individuals are often unaware of justifications for their beliefs, yet this does not disqualify their claims to knowledge. This principle is in conflict with the internalist emphasis on conscious access.**, **It is implausible to claim conscious access is necessary for justification given the documented cognitive limitations in accessing such processes.**
