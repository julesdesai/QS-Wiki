## Content

**Imagine a belief formed on evidence that is currently adequate but known to have a high likelihood of being discredited in the near future, such as a scientific theory dependent on potentially falsifiable assumptions. Intuitively, this seems to be a fragile basis for claiming knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires durable justification, where evidence must be robust against realistic challenges, not merely temporarily adequate.**
