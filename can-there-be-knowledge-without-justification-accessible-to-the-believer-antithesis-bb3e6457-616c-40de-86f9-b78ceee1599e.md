## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, by sheer coincidence, holds a true belief, with external justification existing unbeknownst to them. Intuitively, we would tend to deny that this person has knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a person can know something if the justification for their belief is completely external and inaccessible to them.**
