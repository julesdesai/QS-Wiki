## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person is in an environment that is atypical or artificial, such as a knowledge-producing simulation. Intuitively, we might still want to say that the person knows something despite the environment not being typical.**, **A person might have a true belief resulting from cognitive processes that function adequately in an atypical environment. It seems implausible to deny this person knowledge if the belief is otherwise reliable and true.**
