## Content

**Suppose two people, A and B, discuss whether they know a specific proposition. If A is in a context with low epistemic standards and B is in a context with high standards, A might say she knows the proposition while B correctly claims he does not know it.**, **If A can know while B does not, despite having the same beliefs and truth conditions satisfied, it creates a contradictory situation where the same proposition is both known and not known simultaneously.**
