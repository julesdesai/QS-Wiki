## Content

**Imagine someone deduces a true proposition based on context-relative justifications that, due to universal core defects, do not align. Intuitively, they lack knowledge despite contextually fitting justifications.**, **The universal core defect implies flawed applicability in aligning with varied context-relative justifications, challenging its role in ensuring knowledge.**
