## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, due to luck, forms a true belief by exercising their cognitive virtues. Intuitively, it seems that luck diminishes their claim to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that luck can undermine knowledge even if cognitive virtues are exercised. This principle together with the role of luck entails that the belief might not constitute knowledge.**
