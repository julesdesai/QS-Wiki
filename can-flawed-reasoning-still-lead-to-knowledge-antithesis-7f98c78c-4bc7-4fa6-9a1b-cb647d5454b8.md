## Content

**Suppose an individual arrives at a true belief through flawed reasoning but later gains a better justification that is not defeated by evidence. Intuitively, their initial flawed reasoning may undermine the integrity of their knowledge claim.**, **It is plausible that coherent and reliable reasoning is essential for maintaining a justified true belief as knowledge. This principle coupled with reliance on initial flawed reasoning challenges the notion of acquiring knowledge.**
