## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief is both true and produced by a reliable process, yet their belief is true purely by luck due to unknown interfering factors. Intuitively, we would not consider this knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge excludes truth by mere luck. This principle together with the presence of unknown interfering factors shows that the belief cannot amount to knowledge.**
