## Content

**Occasionally, unreliable processes result in true beliefs more often than expected purely by chance.**, **A person might use intuitive guesswork, which is generally unreliable, but due to consistent outcomes, their beliefs are true and hence seen as knowledge.**, **This suggests that whether a process is unreliable is sometimes context dependent, challenging the necessity and sufficiency of a reliable process for knowledge.**
