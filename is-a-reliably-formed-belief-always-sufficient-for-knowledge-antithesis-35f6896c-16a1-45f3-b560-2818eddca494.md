## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition due to a reliable cognitive process, but the process relied on an initial lucky guess that happened to be true. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not genuinely have knowledge.**, **Suppose a person flips a coin to answer a true or false question, and the coin flip suggests the correct answer. Although the coin toss is a reliable process in this instance, intuitively, we would not say the person has knowledge.**
