**Imagine two students, both believing they aced a test; one learned from past scores that they tend to overestimate, but their seemings still justify belief.**, **Both students have prima facie justification based on appearances, yet only one who actually aced the test has knowledge.**, **The disparity shows that something beyond appearance and belief is necessary to distinguish knowledge effectively.**
