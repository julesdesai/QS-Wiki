## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person's belief is true but not due to their intellectual virtue. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge this might be a case of lucky guessing rather than knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be connected to the truth of the proposition through an appropriate means, such as justification or evidence. This principle along with the reliance on intellectual virtue suggests possible incoherence in cases where virtue leads to truth by chance alone.**, **If intellectual virtue alone is sufficient and not reliably leading to truth, then there may be gaps in explaining some knowledge cases.**
