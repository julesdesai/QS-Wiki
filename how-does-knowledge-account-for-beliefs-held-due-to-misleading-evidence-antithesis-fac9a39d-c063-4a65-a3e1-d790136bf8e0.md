## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition due to misleading evidence. If the evidence were shown to be false, they might still believe it, which challenges the view that they know the proposition.**, **It is implausible to claim that one has knowledge if their belief is maintained by deceptive evidence, thus suggesting sensitivity is not met in such cases.**, **Cases of misleading evidence show that belief sensitivity does not always align with knowledge, as belief may persist inaccurately even when counterfactual scenarios demonstrate falsehood.**
