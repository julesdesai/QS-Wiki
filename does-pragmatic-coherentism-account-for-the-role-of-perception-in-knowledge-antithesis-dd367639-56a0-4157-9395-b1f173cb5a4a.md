## Content

**There is a plausible principle that perceiving an event or object provides a direct form of justification or evidence that cannot be purely replaced by coherent beliefs, posing a challenge if pragmatic coherentism excludes this perceptual justification.**, **Consider a situation in which a person perceives an event but their set of coherent beliefs does not align with this perception. Intuitively, the direct perception can be seen as outweighing the coherent beliefs, challenging the idea that coherence alone is sufficient for knowledge.**
