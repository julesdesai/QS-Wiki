## Content

**Suppose psychological studies show that many beliefs thought to be foundationally grounded are actually products of internal psychological biases.**, **If empirical evidence suggests that foundational beliefs are significantly influenced by biases rather than external factors, this casts doubt on their truth and reliability.**, **The influence of such biases questions whether beliefs truly derive from reliable external factors, as required for knowledge.**
