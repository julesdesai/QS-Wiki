## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person with a usually reliable weather-predicting machine asserts it will rain tomorrow, but the machine is coincidentally broken and outputs the correct prediction for the wrong reasons. Intuitively, the belief does not amount to knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a person reads a true news report from a usually reliable source; however, the source not verifying the article and it coincidentally being true would make us question whether the person truly has knowledge.**
