## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justification for knowledge should be able to explain and remedy cases of justified belief that turn out to be false. Coherentist justification might not always address such situations adequately.**, **Suppose we have a case where a mathematician holds a coherent belief about a faulty proof due to systematic errors. Intuitively, this coherence should not account for knowledge as it cannot rectify the mistake.**
