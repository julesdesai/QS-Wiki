## Content

**Imagine someone who uses a reliable financial tracker to manage their investments. A co-worker with access to the system, however, falsifies the data to make it appear investments are growing when they are actually failing. Despite the reliability of the tracking process itself, intuitively, the person does not know the actual state of their investments.**, **For a belief to qualify as knowledge, the process through which it is formed must be insulated from manipulation or deception. External interference can compromise even reliable processes, resulting in false beliefs that are mistakenly categorized as knowledge.**
