## Content

**Consider a person who understands conflicting evidence concerning a true proposition but comes to believe the truth through sheer insight. Intuitively, we might attribute knowledge despite the inconsistent process.**, **This violates sensitivity as if the proposition were false, inconsistent processes would not necessarily change their belief, marking a failure in belief adjustment required by sensitivity.**
