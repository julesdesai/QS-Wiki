## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone gains extensive true understanding of a domain purely through repetitive exposure rather than intellectual virtue, resulting in correct beliefs about propositions they don't actively believe or engage with. Intuitively, we might still consider this to be a form of knowledge.**, **It is implausible to claim that the conjunction of belief, truth, and intellectual virtue is required for knowledge in all circumstances.**
