## Content

**Suppose we have a hypothetical situation where a detective solves a crime based on intuition rather than evidence that would suffice in court. Intuitively, even with contextual justification, we would hesitate to claim real knowledge without evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification must be evidence-based to be truly considered knowledge, contrasting with relying solely on context to justify beliefs.**
