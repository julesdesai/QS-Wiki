## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition, has justification for it, and the proposition is true by sheer coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite having justified true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a belief is true solely due to luck, it does not qualify as knowledge. This principle together with the scenario suggests that justified true belief with no defeaters may not be sufficient for knowledge.**
