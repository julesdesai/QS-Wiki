## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which two individuals believe the same true proposition, but one forms the belief through complex reasoning while the other guesses. Intuitively, we either have to say that both know or only the reasoner knows. If we say both know, then the theory ignores cognitive differences, which seems implausible. If we say the guesser does not know, then safety is challenged as being insufficient.**
