## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Alex believes that a court decision was correct because it aligns with their pre-existing beliefs and biases about the case. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Alex does not know the decision was correct despite having a justified true belief, due to reliance on cognitive bias rather than objective reasoning.**
