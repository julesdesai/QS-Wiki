## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires an appropriate causal or evidential connection between beliefs and truths. This principle suggests that mere coherence with a dynamic belief system is insufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a person's belief is true and coherent within a dynamic system, yet they arrived at this belief through unreliable means. Intuitively, we would judge that this belief does not amount to knowledge.**
