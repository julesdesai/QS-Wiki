## Content

**Suppose a person correctly predicts tomorrow's weather based on known patterns, but in many altered circumstances, this method would lead to incorrect predictions. Intuitively, the person could still be said to have knowledge of tomorrow's weather.**, **The ability to form a true belief under specific conditions may merit recognition as knowledge, even if susceptible to error in other contexts.**, **An inadequate account of how likely false beliefs could still fulfill practical or theoretical needs might threaten the validity of the strict safety condition.**
