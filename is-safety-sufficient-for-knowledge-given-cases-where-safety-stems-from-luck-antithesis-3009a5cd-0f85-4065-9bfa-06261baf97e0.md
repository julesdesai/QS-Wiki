## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes it will rain because a normally unreliable source predicted it, and it actually rains due to unusual weather patterns**, **This belief is true and safe from being false due to luck rather than the reliability of the source**, **Intuitively, we may judge that the person does not possess genuine knowledge about the weather in this case despite the safety of their belief**
