## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief without any apparent justification, perhaps through a lucky guess or intuition. Intuitively, we could argue that the person knows the proposition despite lacking traditional justification.**, **It is implausible that all instances of knowledge require standard forms of justification when their truth is self-evident or obvious to the knower by other means.**
