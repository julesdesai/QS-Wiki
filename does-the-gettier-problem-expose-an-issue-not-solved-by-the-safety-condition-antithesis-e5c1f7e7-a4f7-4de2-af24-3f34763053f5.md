## Content

**Consider two men, Smith and Jones, applying for a job. Smith believes "the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket" based on strong evidence. Unbeknownst to Smith, he himself also has ten coins in his pocket, and he gets the job. Intuitively, Smith does not have knowledge.**, **In nearly all nearby possible worlds, Smith's belief is true, yet the accidental nature of the truth challenges the sufficiency of safety for knowledge.**
