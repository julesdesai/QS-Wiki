## Content

**Reliability may not account for specific conditions under which a process might fail, suggesting a gap in ensuring knowledge.**, **Consider a process reliably identifying dogs but failing with similar-looking wolves under rare circumstances. If one correctly believes a wolf is a dog due to rarity, it challenges whether such a belief constitutes knowledge despite general reliability.**
