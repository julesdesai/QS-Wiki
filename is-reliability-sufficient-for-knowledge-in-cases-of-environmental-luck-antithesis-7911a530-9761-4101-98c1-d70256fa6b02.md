## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief is formed in circumstances where luck plays a role in its truth, it cannot constitute knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which someone forms a belief about the time from a clock that normally works reliably but is, unbeknownst to them, broken and only by chance displays the correct time. Intuitively, we would not say that the person knows the time.**
