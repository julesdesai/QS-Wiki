## Content

**Consider someone who knows a necessary truth, such as a mathematical fact. Intuitively, even if their belief wouldn't change were it false, the impossibility of the truth being otherwise conflicts with the sensitivity condition as it can't accommodate necessary truths.**, **The requirement of sensitivity becomes problematic for necessary truths, suggesting an inadequacy in situations where the truth cannot be otherwise.**
