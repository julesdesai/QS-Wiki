## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person claims to know a proposition when discussing it with friends, but not when discussing it with experts. Intuitively, either the person has knowledge or does not, regardless of who they are talking to.**, **It is implausible that the truth value of a knowledge claim should change merely because of a difference in who is present in the conversation.**, **The principle that a person either knows a proposition or does not entails that flexible standards might weaken consistent knowledge ascriptions.**
