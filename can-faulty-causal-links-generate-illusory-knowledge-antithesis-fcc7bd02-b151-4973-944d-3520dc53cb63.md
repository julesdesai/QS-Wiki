## Content

**Imagine a case where a person observes accurately the time on a clock that usually displays the wrong time but happens to be right by sheer coincidence at the moment. The person relies on this faulty clock to form a belief about the current time. Here, despite the incidental truth, intuitively we would not consider the person to possess knowledge due to the unreliable causal mechanism.**
