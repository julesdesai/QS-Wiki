## Content

**Imagine a case where a person believes a proposition with justification that is deemed sufficient in an ordinary context but insufficient in a skeptical context. Intuitively, it is troubling if the person's status of knowing changes depending on the context of evaluation.**, **It is implausible that a person's knowledge status should hinge on differences in context that they are unaware of or cannot access.**
