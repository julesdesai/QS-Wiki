## Content

**Imagine Alice firmly believes that her lottery ticket is not a winner based on the low probability of winning, it is indeed not a winner, and her belief seems to hold in all relevant contexts without special evidence. Intuitively, we hesitate to say she knows her ticket is a loser simply based on belief, truth, and context stability.**, **Suppose it is suggested that knowledge merely being belief, truth, and contextually stable belief might be insufficient. Intuitively, Alice lacks knowledge because her belief lacks specific evidence even if it holds in all relevant contexts.**
