## Content

**Consider a scenario involving a necessary truth like a mathematical fact. Intuitively, we would judge that knowing a necessary truth does not require sensitivity, as the proposition cannot be false.**, **The sensitivity condition fails for necessary truths because it claims a belief in a necessary truth would not hold if the proposition were false, which is impossible for necessary truths.**
