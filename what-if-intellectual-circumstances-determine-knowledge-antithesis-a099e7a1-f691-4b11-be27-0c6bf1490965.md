## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two individuals have the same true belief acquired by reliable methods, but one is in an intellectually hostile environment where those methods are undervalued or discouraged. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might attribute knowledge to the first individual but question it for the second due to external factors. The dependence on intellectual virtues alone seems insufficient to account for these environmental influences.**
