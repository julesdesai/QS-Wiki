## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a personâ€™s faculties are functioning in a way designed to be reliable, yet due to environmental deception, they are not reliably aimed at truth.**, **Intuitively, if a person's faculties yield true beliefs due to mere luck or deception, this does not amount to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not only proper functioning but also reliable processes. Without reliability, proper function alone might not suffice for knowledge.**
