**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their justification forms an infinite chain**, **The infinite chain of justification must be coherent rather than strictly causal**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their justification is an infinite coherent chain**
