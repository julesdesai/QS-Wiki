## Content

**A cognitive process may produce a true belief reliably but based on lucky coincidences rather than genuine knowledge.**, **Imagine a case where a person habitually guesses lottery numbers and occasionally guesses correctly, forming a true belief each time. Although the guessing could be seen as reliable in terms of true outcomes, intuitively, these true beliefs do not constitute knowledge.**
