## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person believes a true proposition and knows it but inaccurately assesses their belief is sensitive, leading them to doubting they know it. Intuitively, we would judge the person knows the proposition but lacks higher-order knowledge of knowing that they know.**, **Higher-order knowledge requires not only true beliefs but also reflection upon those beliefs, suggesting sensitivity may not encompass all aspects needed for this kind of knowledge.**
