## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knew a historical fact due to strong evidence they once had. However, over time, they have forgotten the evidence itself while retaining the belief. In such a scenario, intuitively we may judge that the person no longer knows the proposition, despite it being true and originally supported by evidence.**, **Knowledge intuitively requires ongoing access to evidence or justification for a belief. If the evidence is forgotten, it challenges the view that belief can be justified based solely on past evidence. This scenario suggests that mere past possession of evidence might not suffice for current knowledge.**
