## Content

**Consider a case where person P's belief that their partner is at home coincidentally matches with evidence they hear, like footsteps, not actually from their partner but another source. Intuitively, this accident makes it seem that P does not know their partner is home, despite the correct statement.**, **Such scenarios question the robustness of the anti-luck provision since despite factual correctness, the indirect path casts doubt on the knowing status.**
