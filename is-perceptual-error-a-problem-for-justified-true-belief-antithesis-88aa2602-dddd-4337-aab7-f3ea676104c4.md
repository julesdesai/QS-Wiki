## Content

**Consider a person looking at a sheep in a field through a dirty window, which distorts the image, leading them to believe they see a sheep when it is actually a white rock painted to look like a sheep. Unknown to them, there is a real sheep out of sight in the field. Their belief that there's a sheep in the field is true due to the hidden sheep, and their initial observation provides justification.**, **Intuitively, the person does not have knowledge of the sheep due to the incorrect basis for their belief, questioning the sufficiency of justified true belief.**
