## Content

**Consider a situation where a person happens upon an unusual but true scientific theory and believes it. The belief is true, yet accidentally formed. Intuitively, this challenges the safety condition's ability to account for all true belief instances.**, **Were accidental true beliefs to be excluded, safety would conflict with common intuitions about forming true beliefs by fortune rather than safe methodology.**
