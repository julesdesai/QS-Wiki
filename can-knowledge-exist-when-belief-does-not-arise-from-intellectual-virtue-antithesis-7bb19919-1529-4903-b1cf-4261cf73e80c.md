## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on reliable but non-virtuous processes, such as a hunch that turns out to be true. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person has knowledge despite the belief not arising from intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible that a belief needs to arise from intellectual virtue in all cases of knowledge.**
