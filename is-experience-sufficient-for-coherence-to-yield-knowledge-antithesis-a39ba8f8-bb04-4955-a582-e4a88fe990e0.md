## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a personâ€™s beliefs are coherent and supported by sensory experiences that are hallucinatory or otherwise misleading. Intuitively, we either have to say that their coherent belief system constitutes knowledge or that it does not. If we say that it constitutes knowledge, then we allow for falsehoods to be known, which is problematic. If we say it does not, then experiential support alone is insufficient to guarantee knowledge.**
