## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person frequently uses a reliable smartphone app to check stock prices. If the app becomes unreliable due to a hidden defect, intuitively, we would judge that the person's future beliefs about stock prices are not knowledge, even if some are true.**, **There is a plausible principle that changes in process reliability affect the epistemic status of derived beliefs. This principle together with the potential for reliability fluctuation entails that current reliability doesn't guarantee future knowledge.**
