## Content

**Imagine an individual, Charlie, who knows a proposition due to external aids, such as technology or rigorous training, despite impaired cognitive faculties. Intuitively, we would judge that Charlie knows this proposition albeit unconventionally.**, **The requirement for proper cognitive function appears to exclude cases where knowledge is acquired through compensatory mechanisms or external supports, questioning the necessity of proper internal function.**, **Modern technology often enables knowledge acquisition regardless of individual cognitive function, suggesting knowledge can exist independently of cognitive state.**
