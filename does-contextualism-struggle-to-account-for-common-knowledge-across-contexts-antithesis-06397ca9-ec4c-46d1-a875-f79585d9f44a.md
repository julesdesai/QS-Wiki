## Content

**There is a plausible principle that some common knowledge should be widely valid across contexts. This principle together with contextualism's context-dependent justification standards implies a tension in explaining how commonly accepted facts are known.**, **Consider a scenario where different cultures have different contexts affecting justification for common scientific facts. Intuitively, these should remain knowledge irrespective of varying contexts, which contextualism struggles to explain.**
