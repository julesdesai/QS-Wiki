## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition due to misleading evidence, such as fake documentation that incidentally aligns with reality. Intuitively, we would judge that the deceptive nature of such evidence should undermine claims to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, the evidence leading to belief must not be systematically misleading. This principle suggests deceptive causal chains compromise the integrity of knowledge.**
