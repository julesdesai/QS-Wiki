## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a true belief about a historical fact but is unaware of the justification they have for it. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge because they lack awareness of their justification. This challenges the sufficiency of mere justified true belief for knowledge.**
