## Content

**Suppose a scenario where conversational standards of knowledge in a context demand that participants disregard what is factually true to agree on a convenient fiction to maintain social harmony. Intuitively, it is troubling to claim someone knows a proposition if that proposition is false, regardless of the conversational context.**, **The idea that a proposition must be true for a person to know it might clash with contexts where truth is negotiable, causing tension with the principle that knowledge requires truth.**
