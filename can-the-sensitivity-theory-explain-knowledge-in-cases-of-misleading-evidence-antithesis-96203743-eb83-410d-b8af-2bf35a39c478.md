## Content

**Suppose a person, Tom, holds a belief based on well-supported evidence indicating the presence of a zebra at the zoo, while it is actually a cleverly disguised mule. In a case like this, Tom believes correctly because the mule is concealed perfectly.**, **Intuitively, Tom does not have knowledge despite the belief being true and would not believe if false, since the decision relies on misleading information. Misleading evidence poses a challenge for the sensitivity condition as it affects reliability.**
