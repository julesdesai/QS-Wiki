## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person holds a belief that coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs and is justified by the context but is based on faulty evidence; intuitively, it seems the person lacks knowledge despite coherence and contextual justification.**, **Consider a case where an individual believes a proposition, which turns out to be true by coincidence, and the belief coheres with their other beliefs and the context; intuitively, we might judge that the person does not have knowledge due to the accidental nature of the truth.**
