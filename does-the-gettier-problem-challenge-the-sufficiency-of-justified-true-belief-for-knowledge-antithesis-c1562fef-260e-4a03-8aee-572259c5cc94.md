## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person has a justified belief that a certain individual will get a job because they have strong evidence, like seeing the company newsletter listing that individual's name. The person doesn't know that the newsletter was printed incorrectly. Another individual, unexpectedly, gets the job. The original person's belief is true because of a coincidence, not because of any real causal connection with their justification.**, **In this scenario, intuitively we sense that the person does not actually 'know' the individual who received the job would get it, despite having a true, justified belief.**
