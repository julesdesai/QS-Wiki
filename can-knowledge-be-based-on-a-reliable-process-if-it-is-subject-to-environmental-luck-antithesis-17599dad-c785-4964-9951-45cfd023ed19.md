**Consider a scenario where a person, Samantha, is in a barn facade county and sees a single real barn among many fake ones, forming the belief "That's a barn."**, **The belief that "That's a barn" is true and formed via a process that is generally reliable in the normal environment without barn facades.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that Samantha doesn't truly know that "That's a barn" due to environmental luck.**
