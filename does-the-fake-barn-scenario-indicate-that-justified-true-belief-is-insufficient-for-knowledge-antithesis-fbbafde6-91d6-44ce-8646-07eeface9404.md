## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is driving through an area with many fake barn facades that look identical to real barns. They believe they see a real barn, and in this specific case, the object they see is a real barn. Although their belief is justified and true, intuitively, we would judge that they do not have knowledge because their belief is based on misleading evidence.**
