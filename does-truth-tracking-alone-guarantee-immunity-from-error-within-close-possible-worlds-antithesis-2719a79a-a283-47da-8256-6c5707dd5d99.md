## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief consistently tracks truth within a narrowly defined set of possible worlds but allows for error in a broader context. Intuitively, this narrow immunity does not seem sufficient for genuine knowledge.**, **The restriction of immunity from error to only some close possible worlds suggests inadequacy in claiming it as part of a sufficient condition for knowledge.**
