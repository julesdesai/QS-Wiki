## Content

**It is plausible that having justification for a belief requires not having significant misleading evidence. This principle together with the possibility of having correct evidence alongside misleading evidence implies that justification may be inadequate for knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition with both solid and misleading evidence. Intuitively, such a scenario weakens the claim that they know the proposition.**
