## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition is true based on credible authority or evidence but cannot personally generate an infinite chain of reasons. Intuitively, it seems possible they could still know the proposition.**, **It is implausible that individuals have cognitive access to an infinite chain of reasons due to human limitations in reasoning capabilities.**
