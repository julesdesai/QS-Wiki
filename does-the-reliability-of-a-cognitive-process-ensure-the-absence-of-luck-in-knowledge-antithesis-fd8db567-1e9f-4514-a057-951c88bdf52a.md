## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge excludes luck. This principle together with the observation that a person can have a belief that is true, justified, and produced by a reliable process yet still be largely a matter of luck entails that reliability cannot fully account for the absence of luck in knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a person uses a reliable cognitive process in an unreliable situation, such as trusting a usually accurate weather forecaster in a chaos-prone area. Intuitively, if their belief turns out true by chances unrelated to the process, it does not constitute knowledge.**, **Knowledge should reflect a meaningful connection between belief and reality, which pure reliability may fail to secure in all instances.**
