## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual believes a true proposition with seemingly adequate reasons, but significant external counter-evidence exists unknown to them. Intuitively, one might question if the individual truly knows when such counter-evidence exists.**, **Suppose we have a case in which all apparent factors align for knowledge, yet undisclosed countervailing information could undermine the belief. Intuitively, either the person is unaware of crucial evidence, affecting knowledge, or otherwise, which questions sufficiency of known reasons.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires consideration of all available evidence, including potential unknowns that might negate current reasons.**
