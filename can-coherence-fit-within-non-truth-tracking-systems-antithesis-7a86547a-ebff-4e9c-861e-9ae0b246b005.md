## Content

**Suppose a person adheres to a coherent belief system that, by its nature, does not aim to track truth but rather maintains internal consistency for other purposes. They claim to know various propositions. Intuitively, such claims do not count as knowledge.**, **Non-truth-tracking belief systems can be coherent but fail to provide knowledge.**, **Merely fitting beliefs within a coherent, non-truth-oriented system seems insufficient for knowledge.**
