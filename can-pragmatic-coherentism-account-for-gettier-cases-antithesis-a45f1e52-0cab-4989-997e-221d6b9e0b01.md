## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence, the proposition is true, and the belief coheres with other successful practical beliefs, but the belief also happens to be true coincidentally. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite the coherence and truth of the belief.**, **A case could be constructed where the coherence of a belief system leading to successful practical engagement is due to luck rather than a reliable connection to truth. Intuitively, this undermines the idea that knowledge is present.**
