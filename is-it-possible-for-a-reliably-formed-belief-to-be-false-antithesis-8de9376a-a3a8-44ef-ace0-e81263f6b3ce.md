## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist uses a normally reliable instrument, which is malfunctioning without the scientistâ€™s knowledge, leading to a false belief about a measurement. Intuitively, we would judge that the scientist does not know the measurement result, because the belief is false.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth, so a false belief cannot constitute knowledge, even if formed through a seemingly reliable process.**
