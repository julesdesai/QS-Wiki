## Content

**A case where a person believes a true proposition based on evidence that would have led them to believe a false proposition in a similar situation presents a challenge. Intuitively, it seems they do not have knowledge in such cases, as the evidence could not distinguish truth from falsehood.**, **It is implausible that one can have knowledge when the belief tracks the truth in a way indistinguishable from tracking an easy-to-conceive falsehood. This questions if mere truth-tracking across similar situations is sufficient for knowledge.**
