## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a scientist believes a hypothesis based on a series of experiments, but it turns out the experiments involved unnoticed biases that luckily didnâ€™t affect results. Intuitively, we might still consider this knowledge upon peer verification of results.**, **There is a plausible principle that some forms of incidental luck do not preclude knowledge if core reliability is preserved.**
