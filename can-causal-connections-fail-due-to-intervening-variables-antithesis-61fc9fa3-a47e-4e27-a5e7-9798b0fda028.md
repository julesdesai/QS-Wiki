## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a tree swaying and forms the belief that it is windy. However, unbeknownst to the person, large fans have been hidden and are causing the tree to sway without wind. The visual process connecting their belief to a fact about the tree's swaying is reliable in typical circumstances. Intuitively, we would say that the person does not know it is windy because of the causal break by the fans despite the visual reliability.**
