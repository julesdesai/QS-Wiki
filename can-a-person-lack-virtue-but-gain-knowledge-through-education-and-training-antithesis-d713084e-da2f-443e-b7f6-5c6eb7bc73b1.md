**Suppose someone gains knowledge through rigorous education and systematic training rather than innate intellectual virtues.**, **This training equips them with accurate beliefs in their area of study without necessarily fostering broader virtues.**, **If knowledge acquisition is contingent on virtue, it seems their knowledge through education should not qualify, yet intuitively it seems they do know.**
