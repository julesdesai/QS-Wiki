## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person is in a skeptical scenario (e.g., a brain in a vat) where their beliefs would be the same whether the proposition is true or false. Intuitively, the standard for knowledge in such scenarios seems unmet because they cannot distinguish truth from falsehood.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should withstand skeptical doubt to some extent, yet sensitivity fails to secure knowledge because it collapses under skeptical scenarios.**
