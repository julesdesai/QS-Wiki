## Content

**Suppose a case where a person believes a man is guilty of theft because they mistakenly interpret a witnessâ€™s misstatement as evidence, and it turns out the man is indeed guilty based on unrelated evidence. Intuitively, it seems the person does not know the man is guilty, even though the belief is true and aligned with reality**, **In this scenario, the belief arises from error, questioning whether the causal link justifies the claim to knowledge and whether it is appropriate**
