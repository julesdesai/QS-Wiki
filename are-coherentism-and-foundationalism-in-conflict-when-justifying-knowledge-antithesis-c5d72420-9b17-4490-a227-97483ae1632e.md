**In coherentism, the justification of beliefs relies on the coherence of the entire belief system rather than foundational beliefs.**, **Coherence among beliefs may provide justification without requiring foundational, non-inferential beliefs.**, **If coherence among beliefs provides sufficient justification, then foundational beliefs are not necessary for justification.**, **If foundationalism is correct, then coherent justification without foundational beliefs would be inadequate for knowledge.**
