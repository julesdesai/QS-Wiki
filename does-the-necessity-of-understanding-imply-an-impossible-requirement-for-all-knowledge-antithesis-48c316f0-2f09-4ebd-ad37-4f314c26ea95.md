## Content

**Consider the theoretical intuition that requiring all individuals to understand the process's reliability imposes an implausible burden, as many situationally normal cases of knowledge do not involve such in-depth understanding. The need for understanding necessitates capabilities beyond practical provision for everyday agents.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be widely accessible, and demanding deep process understanding makes knowledge inaccessible, thereby questioning the accessibility of knowledge itself.**
