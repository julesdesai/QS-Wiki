## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an unreliable process occasionally produces true beliefs, such as sporadic insights during flawed reasoning.**, **Even if intellectual virtues occasionally guide this process, it is implausible that resulting beliefs consistently amount to knowledge without reliable accuracy.**, **We might intuitively deem these cases as failing to meet the non-accidental truth reflection requirement for knowledge.**
