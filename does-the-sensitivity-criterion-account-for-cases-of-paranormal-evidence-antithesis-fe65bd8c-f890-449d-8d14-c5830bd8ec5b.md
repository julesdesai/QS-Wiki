## Content

**Suppose a person believes in a proposition based on paranormal evidence, which happens to coincide with the truth, such as predicting a rare event. Intuitively, we would not normally say the person knows the proposition.**, **Despite the belief being true, sensitivity requires the belief to change if false, yet the belief might not change in this scenario even if the proposition were actually false, reflecting an insensitivity to truth.**
