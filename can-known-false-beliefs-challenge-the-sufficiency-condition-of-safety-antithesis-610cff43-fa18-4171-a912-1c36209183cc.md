## Content

**Consider a person who has a belief that is true, not easily false, and turns out to be false due to unforeseen future facts, intuitively, the safety condition is challenged because foreseen and unforeseen future knowledge seems to impact the sufficiency condition of knowledge.**, **There is a case where a person believes a proposition which is true and not easily false given their evidence but becomes false due to a later discovery, questioning if the sufficiency condition holds.**
