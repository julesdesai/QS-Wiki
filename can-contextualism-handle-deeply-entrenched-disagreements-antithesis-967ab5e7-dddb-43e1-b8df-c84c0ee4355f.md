## Content

**Suppose two philosophers argue about the same philosophical proposition, with each claiming knowledge based on distinct contextual standards acceptable in their circles. Intuitively, if they both claim knowledge based on context, the dispute might become intractable.**, **The plausible principle that knowledge should help resolve disputes is challenged if the context-dependence of justification means there is no agreed standard for resolution.**
