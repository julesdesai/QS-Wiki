## Content

**It is plausible to think that sensitivity must engage with counterfactual reasoning where belief must accurately reflect potential falsehoods, yet some necessary truths do not allow meaningful counterfactual reasoning.**, **Consider a case involving a mathematical truth, such as the commutativity of addition. Intuitively, such knowledge does not rely on falsehood counterfactuals because its truth is inherently necessary.**, **Sensitivity may be insufficient for knowledge of necessary truths, as they defy the premise of potentially being false, negating the need for counterfactual evaluation.**
