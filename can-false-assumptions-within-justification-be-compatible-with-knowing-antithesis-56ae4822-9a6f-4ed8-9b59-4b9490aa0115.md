## Content

**Imagine a mathematician who derives a theorem correctly, but refers to a commonly accepted yet false lemma, which does not affect the final truth. The intuition might be to say the mathematician indeed knows the theorem.**, **This suggests that knowledge can coexist with instances of false beliefs embedded within a broader justified framework.**
