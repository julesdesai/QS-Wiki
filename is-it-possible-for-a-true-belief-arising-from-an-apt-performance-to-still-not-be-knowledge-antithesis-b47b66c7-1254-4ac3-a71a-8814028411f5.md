## Content

**Imagine a skillful chess player, Alex, who predicts the opponent's move based on expertise, but the opponent changes their intended move at the last moment, matching Alex's prediction by chance.**, **In this scenario, although Alex's belief is true and results from an initially apt performance, the outcome relied on an unforeseen change.**, **This implies that sometimes a true belief, arising from an apt performance, does not equate to knowledge if the outcome is coincidentally altered.**
