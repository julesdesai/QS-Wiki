**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a stock will rise based on intuition with no actual evidence. Unknown to them, reliable market indicators suggest a rise.**, **Intuitively, the person does not "know" the stock will rise due to lack of evidence, even though their belief is correct.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting that knowledge requires awareness of the truth conditions, extending beyond mere true belief.**
