**A belief-forming process is a mental procedure or mechanism that leads to a belief.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a reliable process like a neurological implant that they are unaware of.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that lack of awareness of the process undermines the claim to knowledge, even if the process itself is reliable.**
