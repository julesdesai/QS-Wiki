## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be universally recognized across contexts if the facts remain unchanged. This principle, together with context-sensitive justification, suggests that knowledge claims could lack universal acceptance or validity.**, **Consider a scenario where scientific laws are believed and justified in an academic setting but doubted in informal settings due to context. Intuitively, universal knowledge should not be subject to such variance.**
