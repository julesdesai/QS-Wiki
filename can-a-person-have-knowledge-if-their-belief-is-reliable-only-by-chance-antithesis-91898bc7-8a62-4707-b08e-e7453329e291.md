## Content

**Consider a situation where a person forms a belief using a cognitive process that is generally unreliable, but due to unusual circumstances, the process happens to be reliable in this instance. Intuitively, despite the reliable outcome, it seems incorrect to say the person truly possesses knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliably forming true beliefs by chance undermines the reliability criterion for knowledge. This principle suggests that merely lucky outcomes should not count as fulfilling the reliability condition for knowledge.**
