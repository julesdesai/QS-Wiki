## Content

**Imagine a student who believes a historical date based on a famous historian's work that later gets discredited for inaccuracies. For practical purposes, their knowledge was correct at the time. Intuitively, this seems insufficient upon learning of the discreditation.**, **Historical understanding benefits less from practicality over long term, highlighting a principle where knowledge requires lasting accuracy and contextual understanding beyond practical truth, challenging its sufficiency.**
