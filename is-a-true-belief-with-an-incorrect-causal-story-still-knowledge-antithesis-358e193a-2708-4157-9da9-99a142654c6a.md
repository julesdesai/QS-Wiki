## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition but for the wrong reasons, such as a lucky guess rather than appropriate evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that merely having a true belief with an incorrect causal background is insufficient for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, the causal connection must be appropriately linked to the reason for belief. This principle together with the difficulty in establishing the correctness of causal stories suggests challenges in identifying knowledge.**
