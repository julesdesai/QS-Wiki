## Content

**Consider a high-stakes scenario where life-saving knowledge depends on rigorous justification, but only casual justification standards apply. Intuitively, relaxing justification standards due to context could allow inadequate knowledge claims.**, **Suppose we accept historical beliefs based on context that today seem inadequately justified. Intuitively, this illustrates that contextually justified beliefs might not always constitute knowledge.**
