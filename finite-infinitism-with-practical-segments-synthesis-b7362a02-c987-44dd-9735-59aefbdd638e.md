**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that justification involves an infinite, non-repeating chain but only finite segments of the chain need to be practically accessible**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and there exists both an infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons with practically accessible finite segments justifying the belief**
