## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief based on regular experience, but due to an unanticipated error in their method, would believe falsely if conditions had been different. The sensitivity criterion emphasizes what would happen under counterfactual conditions that, in reality, never manifest. Intuitively, a true belief rooted in typical experiences feels like knowledge even with unactualized error possibilities.**, **The principle that knowledge is undermined by hypothetical incorrect belief suggests a problematic dependence on hardly conceivable situations, possibly disconnecting real-world knowledge from an idealized notion of sensitivity.**
