**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 982cc145-7e65-4eff-a4f0-efc7c8237425
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Knowledge-Based on Proper Function](knowledge-as-knowledge-based-on-proper-function-synthesis-53555bef-1e28-4c2f-bf5f-bf14f3bc1d69.md)

## Content

**Consider a scenario in which new cognitive insights develop or evolve beyond normal parameters, yielding true beliefs with greater accuracy. Intuitively, one might regard these as knowledge.**, **It seems implausible to limit knowledge to current functions when cognitive faculties are dynamic and can evolve to improve truth acquisition.**
