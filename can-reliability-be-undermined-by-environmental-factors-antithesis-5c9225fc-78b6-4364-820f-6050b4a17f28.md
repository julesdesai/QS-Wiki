## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person accurately perceives a tree, but unknown to them, they are in a setting with numerous realistic tree replicas that often deceive others. Intuitively, we would judge that the accuracy of the belief does not amount to knowledge due to the deceptive environment.**, **The presence of deceptive elements can undermine the reliability of the belief-forming process, challenging the sufficiency of reliability for knowledge.**
