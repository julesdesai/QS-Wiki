## Content

**Suppose a person believes a political candidate is trustworthy based on their public speeches and consistent behavior, only for a scandal to emerge post-election discrediting earlier assumptions. Intuitively, this questions the sufficiency of their contextual justification for their belief.**, **It is plausible to assume that shifting practical dynamics necessitate reevaluation of both justification and knowledge sufficiency linked to these changing contexts.**
