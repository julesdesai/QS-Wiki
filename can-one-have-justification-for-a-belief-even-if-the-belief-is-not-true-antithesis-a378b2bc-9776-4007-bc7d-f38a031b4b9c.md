## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Peta, believes a proposition based on strong evidence yet the proposition is false due to an unusual but actual circumstance. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Peta is justified in her belief even though the proposition is false.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification for a belief does not guarantee the truth of the belief. This principle together with the necessity of truth for knowledge suggests that one can be justified but not have knowledge.**
