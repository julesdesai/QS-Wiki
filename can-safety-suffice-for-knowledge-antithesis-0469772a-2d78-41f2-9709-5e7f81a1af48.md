**Parent:** [Nozick's Tracking Theory of Knowledge](nozicks-tracking-theory-of-knowledge-synthesis-3007f7cd-24ed-438d-9179-3ff357b52d6d.md)

## Content

**There is a plausible principle that safety could serve as a better criterion for knowledge. This principle together with cases of belief formed in unsafe conditions entails that tracking is not necessary for knowledge.**, **Consider a case where someone knows a proposition is true because all nearby possible worlds where it is false are completely inaccessible. This counts as knowledge despite the proposition not being tracked.**
