## Content

**Suppose we have a person who forms beliefs reliably through intellectual virtues but relies on those very virtues to confirm their reliability. Intuitively, we either have to say this person has circular justification or their judgment is independently justified. If we choose circular justification, then reliabilism might struggle with foundational justification issues. If the judgment is independently justified, then intellectual virtue cannot be the sole basis for justification.**
