## Content

**Consider a person who feels certain they will always have access to water without confirming the logistics, which happens to be true. The belief is true, justified by past consistency, and free from false lemmas. Intuitively, we might say self-assurance lacks sufficient depth for knowledge without substantiation.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires external validation beyond personal conviction. The insufficiency of external investigation challenges the sufficiency of self-assured beliefs for knowledge.**
