## Content

**Consider a scenario in which various possible worlds exist, and in many similar possible worlds, a person's belief would be false due to slight changes in conditions. Intuitively, we would judge that a belief that is easily falsified in alternate realities lacks robustness typically associated with knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be resilient under minor alterations in circumstances. This principle suggests that counterfactual stability should be considered in evaluating causal connections for knowledge.**
