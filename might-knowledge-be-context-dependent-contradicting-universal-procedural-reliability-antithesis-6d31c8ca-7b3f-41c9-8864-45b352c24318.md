## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief derived from a reliable process in one context is judged by different standards in another, more skeptical context. Intuitively, the notion of context-dependent reliability challenges a universal application of procedural reliability as sufficient for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a reliable process could adequately serve as a one-size-fits-all condition for all contexts of knowledge claims, undermining the universality of such a condition.**
