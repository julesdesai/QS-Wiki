## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a reliable cognitive process like clairvoyance produces true beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that without justification, the person does not have knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which beliefs are true and reliable but lack adequate justification. Intuitively, we either have to say that the beliefs amount to knowledge or that they do not. If we say they do, then we overlook the role of justification. If we say they do not, then we accept that reliability alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
