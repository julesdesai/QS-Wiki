## Content

**Consider a scenario in which justified beliefs are formed based on good but ultimately misleading evidence, such as a reliable source providing false information. Intuitively, we might judge that these justified beliefs are not instances of knowledge, even if they incidentally become true.**, **A principle exists suggesting that justification, while important, may not guarantee that a belief is true, questioning the sufficiency of justified true belief in forming knowledge.**
