## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a reliable process based on flawed science resulting in justified beliefs that later turn out false. Intuitively, we see a gap between reliability and the robustness of justification.**, **A case where justification is built on outdated or incorrect theoretical frameworks supports the notion that reliability alone may not suffice for robust justification.**
