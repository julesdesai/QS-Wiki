## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a personâ€™s belief aligns with probabilistic reasoning based on misleading evidence, making the belief true by accident. Intuitively, despite the alignment with probabilistic reasoning, we would not regard this as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a source of evidence is reliable only if it tends to produce true beliefs. If misleading evidence can lead to true belief purely coincidentally, it challenges the reliability of probabilistic reasoning in this context.**
