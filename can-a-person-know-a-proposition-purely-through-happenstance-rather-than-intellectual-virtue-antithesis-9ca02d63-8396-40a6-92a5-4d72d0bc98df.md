## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intuition can provide true beliefs without the use of intellectual virtues. This principle together with the claim that knowledge relies solely on intellectual virtues suggests that knowledge can be gained non-virtuously.**, **A case in which a person guesses a true fact correctly and believes it reflects the scenario where the belief is true and believed but not because of intellectual virtues. Intuitively, we would not say they have knowledge.**
