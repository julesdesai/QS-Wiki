## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtues are not infallible and can lead to true beliefs that do not constitute knowledge when there is luck involved. This principle together with the notion that virtue epistemology deems this sufficient for knowledge implies that some knowledge claims might be false.**, **Consider a scenario where a person of intellectual virtue infers accurately from misleading evidence resulting in a true belief. Intuitively, this belief should not count as knowledge.**
