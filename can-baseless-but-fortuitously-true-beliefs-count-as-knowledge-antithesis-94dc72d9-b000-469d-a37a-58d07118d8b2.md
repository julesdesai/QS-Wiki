## Content

**There is a plausible principle that beliefs lacking grounding reasoning but surface as true are dubious as knowledge. Imagining a gambler believing a horse will win without evidence, winning, should not intuitively seem as knowing.**, **This principle calls into question if without reason, random luck is discounted enough to claim that component sufficiency of the view is met.**
