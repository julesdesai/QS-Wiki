**Suppose a person knows a truth about weather patterns due to data they studied, but the data subsequently becomes obsolete due to climate change. The person's belief remains unchanged as they no longer keep up with new findings. Intuitively, the outdated evidence and lack of update seem to weaken the claim that they continue to know.**, **Sustained knowledge seems to depend on the relevance and current validity of the evidence. If evidence continuity is disrupted or outdated without awareness, this disrupts the basis for knowledge.**
