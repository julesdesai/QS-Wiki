**Consider David, who reliably and consistently uses complex mathematics to ascertain truths about prime numbers, forming beliefs that are safe in the local world structures.**, **Imagine Evan guessing the same arithmetical truths without understanding the mathematical principles, yet forming beliefs that are also safe, simply due to coincidence.**, **While safety conditions are satisfied in both cases, we would intuitively judge that David possesses knowledge due to his understanding, whereas Evan does not, questioning the sufficiency of the safety condition to capture understanding.**
