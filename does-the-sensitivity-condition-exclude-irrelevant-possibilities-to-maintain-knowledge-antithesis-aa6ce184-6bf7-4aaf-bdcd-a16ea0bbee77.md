## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a true belief but is unaware of highly unlikely but relevant possibilities that would make the proposition false. Intuitively, we might say they still have knowledge despite failure in sensitivity.**, **A principle suggests that excluding all possibilities where the belief would be false is not necessary for knowledge.**
