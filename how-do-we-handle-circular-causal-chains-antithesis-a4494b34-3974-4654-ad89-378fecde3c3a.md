## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief-reasoning chain forms a loop, ending back at the original proposition. Intuitively, this circularity doesn't provide a solid foundation for knowledge.**, **It seems implausible that circular causal reasoning can terminate foundationally as required for true knowledge.**
