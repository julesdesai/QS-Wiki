## Content

**Skepticism is the view that certain or all claims to knowledge are unjustifiable.**, **Requiring an infinite and non-repeating chain of reasons for justification seems to render knowledge claims perpetually unachievable or unsubstantiated.**, **If knowledge requires such an infinite chain, then it appears as though skepticism about most or all knowledge claims could be justified.**
