## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses an unreliable cognitive process, yet the belief formed is true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition because it is true, or that they do not know it because the process is unreliable.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be attributed to someone who relies on an unreliable process, even if the outcome is true.**
