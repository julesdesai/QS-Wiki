**Consider a person who gains knowledge through a perceptual process without forming a conscious belief, such as a child who knows a dog's bark without explicitly believing it to be a dog's bark.**, **Intuitively, one might judge that knowledge can exist without a formed belief if the person can demonstrate understanding or recognition, such as recognizing the sound of a dog's bark.**
