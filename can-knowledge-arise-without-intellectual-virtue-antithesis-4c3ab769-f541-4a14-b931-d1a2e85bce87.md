## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person arrives at a true belief through a reliable process that does not involve the individual's intellectual virtue, such as using a precise instrument. Intuitively, we would have to say that the person has knowledge. If we say that belief arises from intellectual virtue is necessary for knowledge, then such cases cannot be instances of knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on an expert's testimony, where the proposition is true and not significantly lucky, though the belief does not stem from the individual's intellectual virtue. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the proposition.**
