**Necessary truths are true in all possible worlds, and thus the condition that 'if the proposition were false, the person would not believe it' is trivially satisfied.**, **If Nozick’s Tracking Theory is applied to necessary truths, the counterfactual condition becomes vacuous and might include beliefs that do not constitute knowledge.**
