## Content

**Consider a situation where a person behaves in every way as if they know a proposition to be true, consistently acting on it and grasping its implications, yet claiming not to 'believe' it due to pragmatic reasons. Intuitively, this person might still be said to 'know' in some sense despite their verbal disavowal of belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that practical endorsement and understanding of a proposition can count as a form of knowledge, even absent a self-acknowledged 'belief.**
