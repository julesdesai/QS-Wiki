## Content

**Consider historical cases where widely-held and coherent beliefs were later proved false, such as geocentrism. Such coherence did not lead to knowledge, demonstrating coherence alone is insufficient for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence among current beliefs could guarantee knowledge if similar past coherence led to falsehoods.**
