## Content

**There exists a plausible principle that if evidence can misleadingly justify a belief due to factors external to the agent's control, it challenges the status of this belief as knowledge. This principle together with the possibility of unrecognized misleading evidence entails that a belief justified by such evidence may not constitute knowledge.**
