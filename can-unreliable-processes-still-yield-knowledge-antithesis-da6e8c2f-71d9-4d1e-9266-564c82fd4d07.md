## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person stumbles upon the truth by employing an unreliable cognitive process such as guessing, yet repeatedly gets the right answer. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the answer due to the consistent success or that the unreliable process disqualifies this as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that if consistent success leads one to truth, it may constitute knowledge even if the process is unreliable. This suggests that reliability may not be necessary for knowledge.**
