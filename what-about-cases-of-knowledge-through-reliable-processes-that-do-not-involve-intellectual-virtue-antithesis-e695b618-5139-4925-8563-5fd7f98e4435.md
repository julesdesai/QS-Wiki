## Content

**There is a plausible principle that reliability of a process for forming beliefs, rather than intellectual virtues, can lead to knowledge. This principle suggests that the necessity of intellectual virtues for knowledge is questionable.**, **A scenario where a person uses a highly reliable method, such as a thermometer, but lacks intellectual virtues, questions whether virtue epistemology alone explains the knowledge.**
