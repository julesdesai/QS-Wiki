## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone checks the time on a reliable clock and believes it is noon. In such a scenario, intuitively we judge they know the time.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not require counterfactual sensitivity when it comes to mundane propositions as this would lead to skepticism about everyday knowledge. This principle together with the sensitivity condition suggests too strict a criterion for everyday knowledge.**
