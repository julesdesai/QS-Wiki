## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the strength of knowledge lies in the relationship between truth and the evidence directly supporting the proposition, rather than in every peripheral assumption, suggesting minimal false assumptions may not prevent knowledge.**, **Suppose a physicist predicts a natural event accurately based solely on robust scientific evidence, while mistakenly believing in a superstition about unrelated phenomena. Intuitively, the mistaken superstition does not prevent the physicist from knowing the prediction.**
