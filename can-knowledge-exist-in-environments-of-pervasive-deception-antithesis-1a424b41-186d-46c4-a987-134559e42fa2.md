## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual is in a virtual reality where their beliefs about the external world are all true by chance, while the underlying reality is manipulated to fit those beliefs. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the person does not truly have knowledge of the external world.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires reliability, not just truth but also accurate access to the world. This principle together with the possibility of virtual deception raises doubts about whether knowledge can be solely contingent on a truth-conducive connection.**
