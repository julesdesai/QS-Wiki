## Content

**Consider a case where a person's belief about an event is based on an indirect causal chain, such as learning from a reliable second-hand source, rather than a direct causal interaction with the event. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does possess knowledge in this instance.**, **It is implausible that all knowledge requires a direct causal interaction, as many beliefs are formed through some mediated process.**
