## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified belief based on strong evidence that ultimately turns out to be false due to unforeseen factors. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge the person as knowledgeable up to the point of discovery.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires justification and contextually relevant accuracy. This principle together with our intuition entails that truth is not always required for what we consider knowledge.**
