## Content

**Suppose a person claims to know a proposition because it meets contextual justification but would not claim such knowledge in a different context with different justification demands. Intuitively, the truth of the proposition itself should remain constant, irrespective of the context.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be equated to relativistic truth claims based on shifting contexts. If justification standards are context-driven, it threatens to make truth and knowledge conceptually unstable, akin to relativism.**
