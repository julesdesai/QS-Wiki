## Content

**Consider a person P who follows the rule that seeing smoke implies fire but this time it's a smoke machine. P believes there's a fire, which coincidentally is true due to a different unseen fire. Intuitively, P's method seems flawed indicating no knowledge.**, **Such reliability undermined by singular conditions suggests complications in sufficiency principles reliant on virtue and luck absence.**
