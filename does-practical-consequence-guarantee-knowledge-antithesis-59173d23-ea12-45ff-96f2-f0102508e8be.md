## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person accepts a true proposition which has practical consequences but accepts it for the wrong reasons or through faulty reasoning. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that they do not. If we say they know, this conflicts with the intuition that faulty reasoning undermines knowledge. If we say they do not know, then practical consequences alone do not suffice for knowledge.**
