**Imagine a scenario where person P has several beliefs formed by different reliable processes that lead to contradictory conclusions. Intuitively, P cannot have knowledge if their beliefs contradict each other.**, **The possibility of reliable processes producing conflicting beliefs questions their role in establishing coherent knowledge.**
