## Content

**Consider a scenario where a student believes a historical fact after partially skimming a book without fully understanding it, and this fact is true. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the student does not have knowledge, as their justification is not robust enough**, **It is implausible that partial or incremental justification provides sufficient grounds for knowledge as it lacks comprehensiveness required for certainty**
