## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a person's belief about a proposition is justified in one context but is not justified in another context with higher standards. Both contexts rely on subjective interpretations of justification standards. Intuitively, we might judge that the belief is unstable as knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be considered objective if it relies heavily on shifting, subjective contextual standards.**, **There is a plausible principle that objective knowledge requires stable criteria across different contexts.**
