## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which each belief within a foundational set requires justification by another belief in the set. Intuitively, we either have to say that this forms a justified belief through circularity or that it fails to justify completely. If we say it forms a justified belief through circularity, we risk logical inconsistency. If we say it fails to justify completely, then foundational coherentism does not resolve regress in justification.**
