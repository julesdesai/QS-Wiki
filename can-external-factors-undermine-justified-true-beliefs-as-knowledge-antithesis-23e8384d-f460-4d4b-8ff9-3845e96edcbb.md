## Content

**Imagine a student named Alex who guesses answers on a multiple-choice test where their guess is correct due to a printing error in the key. Alexâ€™s belief in the answer is true, and by virtue of the test format, justified, yet intuitively Alex does not know the answer.**, **Consider a scenario in which someone makes a prediction based on scientific data, but the prediction is true due to unforeseen factors not captured in the data. Their belief is justified and true, but intuitively not knowledge.**
