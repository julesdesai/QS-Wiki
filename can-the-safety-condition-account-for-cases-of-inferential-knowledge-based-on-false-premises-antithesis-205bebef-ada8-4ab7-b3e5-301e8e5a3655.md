## Content

**Imagine a case where a person infers a true conclusion from both true and false premises. Intuitively, we might say the person knows the true conclusion.**, **A belief resulting from an inference that includes false premises appears to conflict with the safety condition if the resulting state is viewed as knowledgeable.**, **To account for such inferential knowledge situations, the safety condition might require additional conditions beyond what it presently provides.**
