## Content

**Consider the case where a person correctly believes a proposition due to a reliable method, but unknown to them, there is a rare but damaging environmental factor that could easily mislead them in many similar situations. Intuitively, we might attribute knowledge to the person for this particular proposition.**, **The sensitivity condition fails to accommodate this, as the personâ€™s belief might not change if the proposition were false due to the unpredictable environmental factor that could easily mislead them in similar cases.**
