## Content

**Suppose there are two distinct but internally coherent belief systems with contradictory propositions about a historical event. Intuitively, we would judge that not both systems can provide knowledge of the event.**, **It is implausible that both contradictory coherent systems constitute knowledge. This implies that coherence alone is not sufficient to determine knowledge.**
