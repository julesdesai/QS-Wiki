## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a generally reliable process but has a disposition towards self-deception about particular topics. Intuitively, we would not say that the person truly knows in these cases, even if the belief by chance is true.**, **There is a plausible principle that self-awareness and critical reflection are necessary components for genuine knowledge in addition to belief, truth, and reliability.**
