## Content

**Suppose a reliable process leads a person to a justified true belief, but this is contradicted by strong misleading evidence through experience. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge because of the misleading experiences.**, **It is implausible that simply having a reliable belief-forming process suffices for knowledge if it conflicts with significant evidence.**
