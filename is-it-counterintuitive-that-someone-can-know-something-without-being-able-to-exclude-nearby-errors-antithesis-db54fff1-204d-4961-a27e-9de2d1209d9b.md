## Content

**A person can be in a context where the standards are low enough that they know a proposition without having to consider nearby possibilities of being wrong. Intuitively, if someone knows a proposition, they should arguably be able to rule out obvious nearby errors.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition involves being able to exclude relevant alternatives or errors. This principle implies that knowledge should not be as context-dependent as contextualism allows.**
