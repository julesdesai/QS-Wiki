## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on a lucky guess, and the proposition is true. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than true belief, suggesting a need for an additional justificatory factor.**, **Pragmatic usefulness alone cannot explain why a lucky guess does not amount to knowledge.**
