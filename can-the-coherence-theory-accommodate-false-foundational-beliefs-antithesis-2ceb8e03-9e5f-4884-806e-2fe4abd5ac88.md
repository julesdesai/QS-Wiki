## Content

**Consider a case where foundational beliefs, though false, support a large coherent system of other beliefs. Intuitively, this undermines the whole belief system's claim to knowledge.**, **A coherent system might rest on false assumptions, questioning coherence as a sufficient condition for valid knowledge.**
