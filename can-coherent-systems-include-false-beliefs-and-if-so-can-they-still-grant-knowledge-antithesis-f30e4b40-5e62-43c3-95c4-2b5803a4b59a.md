## Content

**Consider a belief system that is internally coherent but includes several false beliefs that nonetheless support and cohere with each other and some true beliefs. Intuitively, we might question whether any belief within such a system can be truly considered knowledge.**, **Coherence among beliefs does not necessitate that all beliefs within the system are true, allowing for the inclusion of coherent but false beliefs.**, **In a system that coheres but includes falsehoods, it is challenging to claim that coherence alone suffices to determine knowledge.**
