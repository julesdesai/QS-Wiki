**Suppose we have a case in which John remembers that Paris is the capital of France because he learned it in school. It is true, and he believes it.**, **If in a nearby possible world, his memory isn’t reliable and he might believe Paris is the capital of some other country, Nozick's tracking would imply John does not know the capital.**, **It is implausible that John’s well-founded memory doesn’t count as knowledge just because of unreliable memory in some nearby possible worlds.**
