**Suppose someone in a courtroom believes a suspect is guilty because of compelling yet misleading evidence. Intuitively, this belief may be seen as unjustified for claiming knowledge even if the suspect is actually guilty.**, **There is a plausible principle that a true belief based solely on misleading evidence is not a case of knowledge. This principle would conflict with the view that contextual justification is sufficient if the context allows for flawed evidence.**
