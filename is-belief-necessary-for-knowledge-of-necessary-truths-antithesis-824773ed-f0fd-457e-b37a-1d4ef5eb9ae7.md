## Content

**Consider a mathematical truth, such as 2+2=4. One might understand the proposition and acknowledge it as true, yet not necessarily believe it in the same manner belief is typically conceptualized.**, **Intuitively, someone can know a necessary truth, like the sum of 2 and 2, through understanding alone, without needing to articulate a belief in propositional form.**
