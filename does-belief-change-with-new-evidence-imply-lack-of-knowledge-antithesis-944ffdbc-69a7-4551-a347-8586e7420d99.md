## Content

**A person knows a proposition at one time based on infallible external justification but later changes their belief with new evidence.**, **If knowledge requires that the justification be incapable of being overridden, then either the person never had knowledge, or knowledge was lost easily.**, **This situation conflicts with the common idea that we can have knowledge that is revisable in light of new evidence.**
