## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person guesses the outcome of a future event correctly. Intuitively, we would not say they know the outcome before it happens.**, **A person might not believe a proposition in worlds where it is false simply by chance, not because their belief genuinely tracks the truth.**, **Knowledge as Nozick's Tracking Theory may not exclude cases where belief, truth, and counterfactual conditions align purely by coincidence.**
