## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition based on testimony that includes some false information irrelevant to the belief in question. Intuitively, we often still consider this knowledge because the false information does not affect the truth of the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that minor inaccuracies in testimony do not necessarily prevent a belief, otherwise well-supported, from being knowledge.**
