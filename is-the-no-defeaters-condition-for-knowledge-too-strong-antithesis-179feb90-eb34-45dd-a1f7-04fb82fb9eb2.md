## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified true belief that a proposition is true, yet an unknown, unverifiable potential defeater exists. Intuitively, it seems harsh to say that the person lacks knowledge simply because of this possible, undetectable defeater.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should only be impacted by defeaters that the knower can reasonably perceive or be aware of. This principle together with requiring the absence of all possible defeaters entails that knowledge is too easily undermined.**
