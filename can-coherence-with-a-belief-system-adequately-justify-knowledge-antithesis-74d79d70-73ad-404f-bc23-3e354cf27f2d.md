## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a coherent set of interrelated false beliefs. Intuitively, we would not judge that the person knows any proposition within this set.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not only coherence with a belief system but also independent justification grounded in reality. This principle together with the idea that beliefs can cohere without corresponding to the world entails that coherence alone is insufficient for justification necessary for knowledge.**
