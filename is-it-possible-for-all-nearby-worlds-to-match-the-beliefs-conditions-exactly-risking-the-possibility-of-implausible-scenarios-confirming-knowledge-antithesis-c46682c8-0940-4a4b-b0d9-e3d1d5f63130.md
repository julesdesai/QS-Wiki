# Is it possible for all nearby worlds to match the belief's conditions exactly, risking the possibility of implausible scenarios confirming knowledge?

## Content

**Suppose we have a belief that happens to be true because the nearby possible worlds used to test its safety exactly match its conditions against intuition. This suggests implausible scenarios might validate beliefs as knowledge improperly.**, **It is implausible that a belief qualifies as knowledge simply because contrived nearby scenarios artificially protect its truth; genuine variations should test knowledge.**
