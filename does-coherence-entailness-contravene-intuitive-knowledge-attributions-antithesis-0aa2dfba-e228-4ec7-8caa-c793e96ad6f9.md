## Content

**Consider a situation where a person has a coherent system of beliefs that logically entail a proposition they have not explicitly considered or believed. Intuitively, it seems that merely having coherence with other beliefs is insufficient if the person lacks an explicit belief in the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires conscious belief in a proposition, suggesting that coherence alone does not suffice for such conscious belief, challenging the sufficiency condition for knowledge.**
