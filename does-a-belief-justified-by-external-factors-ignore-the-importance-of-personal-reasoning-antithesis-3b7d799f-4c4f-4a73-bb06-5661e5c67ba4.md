## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a true proposition purely due to an external device that manipulates evidence while the person has no reasoning process involved. Intuitively, it does not seem like the person has knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires some degree of understanding or awareness by the knower. A purely external justification seems to lack this element of understanding.**
