## Content

**Consider mathematical truths that are known a priori, meaning they are known independently of experience, like 2+2=4. Intuitively, such knowledge does not depend on aligning with probabilistic reasoning based on available evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that mathematical knowledge is often deductive and certain, in contrast with probabilistic reasoning, which manages uncertainty and lacks deductive certainty.**
