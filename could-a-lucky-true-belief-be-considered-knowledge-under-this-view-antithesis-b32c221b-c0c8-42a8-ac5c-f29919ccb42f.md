## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a lottery ticket is a losing ticket based on the low odds of winning, and the belief is true because the ticket does not win. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the ticket will lose because the belief could easily have been false.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief that is true due to chance or luck does not qualify as knowledge. This principle together with the scenario implies that a true belief formed under circumstances of luck or chance is not knowledge.**
