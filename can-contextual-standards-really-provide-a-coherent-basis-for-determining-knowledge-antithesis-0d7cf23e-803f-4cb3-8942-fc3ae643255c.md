## Content

**Suppose there is a case in which two people discuss whether a person knows a proposition under two different contexts with differing standards. Intuitively, in one context the person knows the proposition, while in the other, they do not.**, **It is implausible that the truth of a knowledge claim about a single proposition can vary solely based on differing contextual standards of the observers.**
