## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual exercises excellent intellectual character traits yet arrives at a false belief due to misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge in this case.**, **There is a plausible principle that cognitive virtues do not always ensure the truth of beliefs. This principle together with the presence of misleading evidence entails that cognitive virtues alone cannot guarantee knowledge.**
