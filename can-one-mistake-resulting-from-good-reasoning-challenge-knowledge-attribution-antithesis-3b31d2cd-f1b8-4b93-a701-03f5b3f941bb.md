## Content

**There is a plausible principle that one error from a generally reliable method does not detract from the method's value, but one false belief might intuitively negate perceived knowledge from the method.**, **Consider a situation where an individual makes a single error arising from intellectual virtues. Intuitively, we doubt the attribution of knowledge when one forte does not preclude a flaw.**
