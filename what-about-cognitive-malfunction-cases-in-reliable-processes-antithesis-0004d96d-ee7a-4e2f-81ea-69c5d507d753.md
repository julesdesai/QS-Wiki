## Content

**Suppose a person, Clara, forms a belief using normally reliable perceptual means but suffers a brain malfunction that produces an accurate belief by chance.**, **The process leading to Clara's belief temporarily fails by objective standards of reliability due to malfunction, yet her belief is coincidentally true.**, **The malfunction undermines knowledge attribution, yet it challenges reliabilism's emphasis on persistent process reliability over occasional accurate belief formation.**
