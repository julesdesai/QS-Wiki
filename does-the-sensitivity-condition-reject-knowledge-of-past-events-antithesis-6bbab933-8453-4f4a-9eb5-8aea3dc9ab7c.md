## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone knows what happened at a specific time in the past because they witnessed it directly. However, if the past event were false, they would not believe it differently now due to the passage of time. Intuitively, we would say they knew the event occurred at the time, but sensitivity implies present non-sensitivity undermines past knowledge.**, **The sensitivity condition requires that if the proposition were false, the belief would also be false, which may not apply retroactively to facts about past events, as the past cannot change.**
