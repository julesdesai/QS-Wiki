## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people are having a conversation about a topic, and Person A claims to know that the library will be open tomorrow based on posted hours, while Person B claims not to know this due to the possibility of unexpected closure. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that knowledge should not be subject to such variations based on conversational context.**, **It is implausible that the truth conditions for knowledge claims should depend on the stakes involved in a conversation.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should have consistent standards regardless of the conversational context. This principle together with the variability of standards in contextualism challenges the objectivity of knowledge claims.**
