## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, George, believes a proposition based on strong justification, like "The clock shows it is 3 PM," but the clock is stopped and accidentally correct. Intuitively, we would judge that George does not know it is 3 PM.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing requires more than belief, truth, and fixed justification; it requires that there be no element of luck in the truth of the proposition.**
