## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person sees what looks like their friend across the street and believes their friend is there, though it's actually a stranger who superficially resembles their friend. Unknown to them, their friend is indeed present but hidden from view. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know their friend is there or that they do not. If we say they know, it seems incorrect as their belief was true by coincidence, not safety. If we say they do not know, then safe belief with true propositions feels inadequate for knowledge.**
