## Content

**Suppose person P has a justified true belief formed through subconscious inference without conscious access to this process. Intuitively, P may not be said to know if P cannot reflectively endorse the belief process, despite its truth and justification.**, **A plausible principle is that reflective access to the justification process is essential for knowledge. This principle implies that subconscious justification does not suffice for knowledge, even if the belief is true and justified.**
