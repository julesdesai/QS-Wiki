## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a true belief based on a reliable source, but unknown to them, the source is accurate by accident rather than reliability, and there are no apparent defeaters. Intuitively, this seems to indicate more epistemic luck than knowledge, undermining the notion that no defeaters are sufficient for knowledge.**
