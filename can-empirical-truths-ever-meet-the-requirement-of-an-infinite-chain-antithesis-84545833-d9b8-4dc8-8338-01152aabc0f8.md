## Content

**Consider empirical knowledge such as "grass is green," which relies on direct sense perception as a justification.**, **An infinite chain of justification is difficult to conceptualize in cases bound by empirical limits, making it seemingly impossible to apply infinitism empirically.**, **If empirical truths struggle to meet this requirement, the universality of the infinitism approach for all knowledge claims is questioned.**
