## Content

**Imagine a person who believes a particular proposition as true when talking to one group and false when talking to another, purely due to contextual shifts. Intuitively, it feels problematic that knowledge should shift based on constant change in context.**, **It is implausible that stable knowledge should fluctuate with continuous shifts in context; the idea that justification depends on context threatens the stability of what is known.**
