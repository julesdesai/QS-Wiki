## Content

**Suppose person P is reading a sophisticated fake book reproduction that is identically indistinguishable from the original, and P has justified reasons to believe it is genuine. Intuitively, even if P forms a correct understanding of the content, P does not have knowledge of the book's authenticity.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires ruling out relevant alternatives or counter-possibilities. This principle together with P's justified belief entails that P lacks knowledge because relevant alternatives have not been defeated.**
