## Content

**Suppose someone has a strong intuitive feeling that a certain statement is true, and it turns out to be true. Intuitively, if this feeling doesn't arise from intellectual virtues, it is questionable to count it as knowledge.**, **The principle that knowledge from intuition lacks an intellectual virtue basis suggests that such beliefs should not be considered knowledge despite their truth.**
