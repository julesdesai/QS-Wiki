## Content

**Suppose Jake strongly believes in a business decision due to low practical stakes, where a mistake is tolerable. His colleague, Lily, with higher stakes, refrains as her job might be at risk. Intuitively, pragmatic considerations influence belief strength but should not alter the truth of a known proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that while beliefs might be affected by pragmatic concerns, knowledge, tied to truth and justification, should remain distinct from mere belief and independent of practical considerations.**, **It is implausible that pragmatic consequences, which rightfully affect belief's application, should redefine an epistemic concept inherently involving truth.**
