## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual forms a belief using a reliable process, but unbeknownst to them, the environment changes in a way that undermines the process's reliability before the belief is formed. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the shift in environment makes the belief production unreliable at the time, thus not constituting knowledge.**, **It seems implausible that an unrecognized change in reliable processes due to external factors can still count as knowledge production.**
