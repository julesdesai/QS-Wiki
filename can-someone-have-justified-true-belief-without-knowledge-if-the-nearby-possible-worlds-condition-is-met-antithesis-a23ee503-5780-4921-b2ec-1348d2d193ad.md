## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a thorough scientific investigation, and all evidence points to its truth. The proposition is true in nearly all nearby possible worlds where the person believes it. Intuitively, we would judge that the person has knowledge in this case, but the nearby possible worlds condition alone does not account for the justification necessary for knowledge.**
