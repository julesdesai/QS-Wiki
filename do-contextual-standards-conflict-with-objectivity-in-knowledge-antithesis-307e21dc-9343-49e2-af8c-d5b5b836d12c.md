## Content

**Contextualism suggests that the standards for knowing a proposition can vary with context, leading to subjective variation in what counts as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be objective and not vary based on extrinsic factors like the standards of different contexts.**, **This principle together with the context variability implies a contradiction, as knowledge would be objective yet subjectively determined.**
