## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, but the circumstances are fragile enough that only hypothetical changes could result in false belief, not actual ones. Intuitively, we might say that the safety condition fails to account for these hypothetical falsehood scenarios.**, **It is implausible that only considering actual circumstances satisfies the safety condition if avoiding knowledge requires considering some likely hypothetical falsehoods.**
