## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition based on reliable evidence, but the evidence ceases to exist in a possible scenario within their world, making the belief false in that scenario. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not have knowledge in such scenarios.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can exist when the belief's truth-tracking fails due to changes in key evidence. This questions the claim that it is sufficient for the belief to track truth across similar situations.**
