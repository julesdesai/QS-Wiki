## Content

**If a belief is true, justified, and formed via a generally reliable process, but the process can err in certain contexts, the belief may not be known. Suppose a person uses a trusted navigation app, which works well in urban areas but fails in rural settings due to poor satellite coverage. If the app guides a driver to the wrong location in the countryside, intuitively, it seems the driver does not know the app's information about their destination.**, **Consider cases where specific environmental conditions cause reliable systems to malfunction or produce false results. When external factors impede the reliability of a belief-forming process, the truth of the resulting beliefs can be compromised. Knowledge must remain unaffected by such irregularities.**
