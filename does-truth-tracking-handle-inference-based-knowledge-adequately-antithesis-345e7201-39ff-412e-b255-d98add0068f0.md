## Content

**Imagine that a formidable detective concludes who committed a crime by inferring it from ambiguous clues, which are consistent with, but do not entail, the truth. Intuitively, this conclusion seems precariously situated between knowledge and a belief based on hunch.**, **The clues do align with the truth, but they do not compel the truth to be known through tracking alone.**, **Truth-tracking might struggle to accommodate knowledge based on inference when this involves interpreting uncertain or ambiguous evidence.**
