## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that a friend drives a particular kind of car based on seeing them drive one. However, it turns out that the friend has borrowed the car for the day and does not own it, yet coincidentally, the friend still owns the same kind of car. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite having a justified true belief.**
