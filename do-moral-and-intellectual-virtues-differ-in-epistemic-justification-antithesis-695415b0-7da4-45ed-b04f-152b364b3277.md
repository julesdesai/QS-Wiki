## Content

**Suppose that a person relies on moral virtues like honesty or generosity rather than intellectual virtues to derive their beliefs. Intuitively, it seems possible for them to acquire true belief or knowledge through these moral virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge could arise from virtues outside the traditional intellectual sphere, suggesting that the necessity of intellectual virtues may be overstated in this view.**
