**Consider a scenario where a person, Sarah, believes it is raining because she sees people carrying umbrellas, but unknown to her, it is actually raining because a sprinkler is on nearby. In this scenario, it intuitively seems that Sarah does not know it is raining despite her belief being true.**, **It is implausible that someone can be said to know a proposition merely because of an appropriate causal relationship if their belief is based on faulty assumptions or misleading evidence.**
