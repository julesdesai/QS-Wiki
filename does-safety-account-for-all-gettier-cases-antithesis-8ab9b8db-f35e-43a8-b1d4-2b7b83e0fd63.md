## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence, the proposition is true, but there is an unnoticed error in the evidence that does not affect the truth in this case. Intuitively, we judge this does not count as knowledge because of the error possibility in the evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that acknowledges Gettier cases reveal something about justifications that can be irrelevant to safety, suggesting that safety alone may not eliminate all such cases.**
