## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge can exist without conscious belief, such as implicit or tacit knowledge. This principle, together with the idea that belief is a necessary condition for knowledge, entails that contextual coherentism might exclude certain kinds of knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a scenario where an individual reliably acts on true information without being able to expressly form a belief about it. Intuitively, it seems such a person might know the information even if they do not consciously believe it.**
