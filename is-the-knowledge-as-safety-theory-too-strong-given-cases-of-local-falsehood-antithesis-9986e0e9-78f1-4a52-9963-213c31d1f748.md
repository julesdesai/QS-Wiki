## Content

**Consider a situation where a person witnesses a car accident and forms a belief based on direct observation that a red car caused the collision. In most nearby possible scenarios, their vantage point would have been obscured, leading to incorrect beliefs despite their actual world belief being true. Intuitively, the proximity of near error does not intuitively eliminate their claim to know what they observed.**, **In this scenario, the person believes the proposition about the carâ€™s color, the proposition is true, and even if the belief in nearby worlds would be false, their current observation seems to affirm knowledge nevertheless.**
