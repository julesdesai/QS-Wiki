## Content

**Consider a person who believes correctly that a stopped clock shows the right time at noon. The person would not believe the clock if it were showing a non-noon time. This doesn't track the relevant truth about the actual time. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not know the time.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires tracking relevant counterfactual situations, not merely any counterfactuals where the belief holds. Since the counterfactuals here are irrelevant to the actual time, they do not have knowledge.**
