## Content

**Consider a case where a person uses sound reasoning and reliable evidence to form a belief in a true proposition, but the proposition turns out to be false due to unforeseen factors. Intuitively, we would still judge that the belief arose from intellectual virtue.**, **If a belief can arise from intellectual virtue and still be false, it challenges the necessity of truth in the concept of knowledge as virtue.**
