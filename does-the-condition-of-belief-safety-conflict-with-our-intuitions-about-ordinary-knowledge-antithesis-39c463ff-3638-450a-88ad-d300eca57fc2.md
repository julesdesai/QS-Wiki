## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief about a friend's presence at a party based on their car being parked outside, whereas the friend actually arrived but by another means. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is not knowledge because the usual basis for the belief could be misleading, or that the presence of the friend validates the belief in this instance. If we say the belief is not knowledge, then we deny that correct outcomes can inform knowledge under some conditions. If we say the belief is knowledge, we question the link between belief safety and knowledge.**
