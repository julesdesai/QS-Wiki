## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if two people have the same evidence, then they should arrive at the same knowledge conclusions.**, **Consider a scenario in which two individuals have the same evidence regarding a proposition but are in different contexts, leading to one having knowledge and the other not. Intuitively, this seems problematic because the knowledge attribution should not vary due to context alone.**
