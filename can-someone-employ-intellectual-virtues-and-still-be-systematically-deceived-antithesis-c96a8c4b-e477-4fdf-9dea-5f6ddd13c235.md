## Content

**Imagine a person uses rigorous scientific methods to deduce their beliefs, but the instruments they use are systematically rigged to produce false results. Intuitively, we would judge that even though the process involved intellectual virtue, the person does not have knowledge because the beliefs are false.**, **It is unlikely that intellectual virtue alone can ensure knowledge if external deception skews the belief-forming process.**
