**Perceptual experiences may provide direct knowledge without the need for coherence with a system of beliefs.**, **If knowledge can be achieved through direct perception, it indicates that coherence with a belief system is not necessary for knowledge.**, **For instance, a person immediately recognizes a friend's face without referencing any beliefs, challenging the necessity of internal coherence for this knowledge.**
