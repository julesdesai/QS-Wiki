## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition purely by guessing, that proposition is true, and there are no defeaters for the belief. Intuitively, we do not consider the person to have knowledge.**, **The absence of defeaters does not imply the presence of evidence or rational support for the belief, which is typically required for knowledge.**
