## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition involves a stable connection between belief and truth independent of context. This principle entails that such a connection should not be contingent upon contextual standards.**, **Consider a scenario where an individual believes a true proposition with sufficient justification in a low-standard context, but their justification is insufficient in a high-standard context. Intuitively, this variability questions the stable relationship between belief and truth as required for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the stable relationship necessary for knowledge can be satisfied if justified belief varies with context.**
