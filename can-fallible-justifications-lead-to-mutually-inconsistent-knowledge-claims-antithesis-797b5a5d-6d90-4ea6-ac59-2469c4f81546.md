## Content

**Imagine two people each have fallible justification for two opposing propositions that cannot both be true. Intuitively, one might suggest that they cannot both have knowledge if their justifications lead to inconsistent beliefs.**, **A principle suggests that knowledge must preserve logical consistency, which is violated if fallible justifications allow mutually exclusive propositions to be known.**
