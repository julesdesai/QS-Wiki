## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief consistently aligns with a virtue but occasionally results in false beliefs due to external factors. Intuitively, we would expect stable truth to be a component of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should consistently track truth over time. This principle together with a belief occasionally being false despite virtue entails skepticism about claiming knowledge.**
