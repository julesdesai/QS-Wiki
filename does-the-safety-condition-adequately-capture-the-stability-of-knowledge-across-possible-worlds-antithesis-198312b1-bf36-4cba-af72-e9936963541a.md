## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should remain stable across a wide range of possible worlds. If knowledge is only stable in a limited subset of nearby worlds, this principle suggests that the safety condition fails to capture the true nature of knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case where a belief is true in the actual world but false in many plausible nearby worlds. Intuitively, such instability indicates a lack of knowledge.**
