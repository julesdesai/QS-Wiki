**Imagine a case where a normally reliable weather forecaster predicts sunshine based on standard meteorological methods but fails to account for an unusual weather occurrence that leads to rain. Intuitively, the forecaster is justified but does not know it will be sunny.**, **The general reliability of forecasting methods does not account for specific cases where the predictions are wrong due to unforeseen variables.**
