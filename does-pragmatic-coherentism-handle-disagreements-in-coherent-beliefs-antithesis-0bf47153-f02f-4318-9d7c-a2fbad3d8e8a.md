## Content

**Suppose two people hold conflicting beliefs that each respectively cohere with their own set of beliefs that lead to successful practical engagement. Intuitively, one might judge that this creates a scenario where at least one person cannot have knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that if two conflicting propositions are both considered true due to coherence, the concept of truth becomes unstable, making it implausible to claim knowledge in both cases.**
