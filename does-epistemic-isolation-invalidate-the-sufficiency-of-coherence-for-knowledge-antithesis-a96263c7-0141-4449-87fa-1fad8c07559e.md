## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a true belief that the Earth orbits the Sun, but this belief does not connect with any other related beliefs, perhaps due to a lack of educational background. Intuitively, we might judge that this belief does not suffice for knowledge.**, **In cases where beliefs are isolated from any system of interrelated beliefs, it is questionable whether such beliefs exhibit coherence.**, **It is implausible to claim that a true belief suffices for knowledge if it remains epistemically isolated from other beliefs.**
