## Content

**Consider a scenario where the epistemic standards change within a context without a change in the proposition's truth value, leading to a reassessment of knowledge. Intuitively, this suggests that factors unrelated to the proposition itself are determining knowledge, which seems misguided.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should primarily depend on the truth of a proposition rather than fluctuating standards.**
