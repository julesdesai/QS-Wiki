## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone knows a fact because their grandmother, a generally reliable knower, asserts it. However, the person does not know of their grandmotherâ€™s reliability and forms the belief out of sheer trust. Intuitively, we would doubt whether this constitutes knowledge.**, **For knowledge, it is plausible that the reliability of the cognitive process should be recognized, at least tacitly, by the believer.**
