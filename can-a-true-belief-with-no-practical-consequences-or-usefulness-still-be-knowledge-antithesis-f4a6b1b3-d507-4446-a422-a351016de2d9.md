## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition, but this belief has no practical consequences and is entirely theoretical. Intuitively, we might still regard this as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can exist even for esoteric beliefs that lack practical application. This principle suggests that practical consequences are not necessary for knowledge.**
