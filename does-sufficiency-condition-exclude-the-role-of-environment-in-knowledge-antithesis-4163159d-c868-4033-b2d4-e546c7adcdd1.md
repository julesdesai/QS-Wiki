## Content

**It is implausible that the mere presence of belief, truth, and intellectual virtue suffices for knowledge when external factors, such as environmental context, significantly influence the reliability and validation of the process.**, **Suppose we have a case where identical cognitive processes yield different outcomes in hostile versus supportive environments. Intuitively, knowledge in only the supportive setting challenges the view's sufficiency as context-independent.**
