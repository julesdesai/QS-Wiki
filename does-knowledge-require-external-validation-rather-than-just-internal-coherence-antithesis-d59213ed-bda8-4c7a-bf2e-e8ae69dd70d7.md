# Does knowledge require external validation rather than just internal coherence?

**Node Type:** antithesis

## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a belief must correspond to external reality in a direct way to count as knowledge. This principle together with the idea that a belief cohering with a system does not ensure such correspondence implies that coherence is not sufficient for knowledge.**
