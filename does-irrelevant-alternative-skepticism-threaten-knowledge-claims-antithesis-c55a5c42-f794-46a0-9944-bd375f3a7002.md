## Content

**Suppose someone believes they have hands based on ordinary sensory perception but is unaware of philosophical skeptical scenarios like being a brain in a vat.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively their inability to rule out the skeptical scenario should not impact their claim to know they have hands.**, **The presence of irrelevant alternatives, which cannot be meaningfully distinguished, should not undermine ordinary knowledge claims.**
