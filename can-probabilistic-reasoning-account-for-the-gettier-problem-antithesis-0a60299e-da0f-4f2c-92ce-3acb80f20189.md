## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief is based on sound probabilistic reasoning given all available evidence and that reasoning supports the truth of the belief, then the belief is justified.**, **Consider a scenario where a person has a justified true belief based on probabilistic reasoning, but this belief is true due to coincidence rather than the evidence itself. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**
