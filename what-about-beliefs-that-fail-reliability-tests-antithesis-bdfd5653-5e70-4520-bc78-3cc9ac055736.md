## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person consistently forms true beliefs based on unreliable evidence like astrology predictions. While these beliefs might be true, intuitively we would doubt they constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be derived from reliable methods. This principle suggests that mere truth-conducive connections may not suffice for knowledge if the belief-forming methods are unreliable.**
