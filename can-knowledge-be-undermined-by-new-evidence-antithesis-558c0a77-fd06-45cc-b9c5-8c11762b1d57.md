## Content

**There is a plausible principle that new evidence can defeat previous justifications. This principle together with the possibility of always acquiring potentially new evidence implies that justification might be perpetually at risk of being defeated.**, **Suppose a person believes a true proposition and has justification for it, but is unaware of counter-evidence they would accept if encountered. Intuitively, we would hesitate to call this knowledge.**
