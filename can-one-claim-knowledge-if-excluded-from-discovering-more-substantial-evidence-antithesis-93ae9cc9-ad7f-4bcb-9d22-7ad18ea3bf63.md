## Content

**Consider a person with a true belief about a proposition supported by weak evidence, while unaware stronger evidence exists which they are unable to access. Intuitively, we would judge their knowledge claim is weak due to their limited access to evidence.**, **It is implausible for knowledge to be claimed authentically if stronger evidence is unobtainable, challenging the sufficiency of weaker evidence.**
