## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person accepts a false proposition that turns out to be practically useful. Intuitively, we would judge that practical usefulness alone does not elevate a false belief to knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that practical usefulness is often a factor independent of truth. This principle suggests that usefulness does not necessarily imply truth.**
