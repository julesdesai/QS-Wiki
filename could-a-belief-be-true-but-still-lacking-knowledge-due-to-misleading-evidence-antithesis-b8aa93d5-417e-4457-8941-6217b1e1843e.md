## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires both belief and truth but not just the absence of defeaters.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence, yet there is misleading evidence which they have not encountered that could have defeated their belief.**, **Intuitively, in such a scenario, the person does not have knowledge because the presence of misleading evidence, though unknown to them, influences the reliability of their belief.**
