## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief about the location of their missing keys because they guessed correctly. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the keys' location.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition, but the belief is true due to luck rather than the exercise of intellectual virtue. It is implausible that this belief qualifies as knowledge despite meeting the truth condition and belief condition.**
