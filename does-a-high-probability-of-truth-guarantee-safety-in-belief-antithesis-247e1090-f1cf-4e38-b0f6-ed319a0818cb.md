## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a person forms a belief based on a highly probable statistical fact, such that in most nearby possible worlds, the fact also holds true.**, **Intuitively, one may feel that despite the closeness in probability to truth, there is a gap between the high probability of safety and the possession of actual knowledge, particularly if the belief lacks justification.**
