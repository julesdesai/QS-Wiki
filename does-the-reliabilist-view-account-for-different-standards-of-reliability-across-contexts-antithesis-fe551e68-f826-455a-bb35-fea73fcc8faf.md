## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a normally reliable cognitive process produces a true belief in an environment where the standards for what counts as reliable are higher, such as in a high-stakes situation. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not have knowledge because what is typically a reliable process may not be reliable enough in this context.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests knowledge is context-sensitive, and reliability needed for knowledge can vary according to contextual standards. This principle challenges whether a fixed reliability standard is sufficient for knowledge.**
