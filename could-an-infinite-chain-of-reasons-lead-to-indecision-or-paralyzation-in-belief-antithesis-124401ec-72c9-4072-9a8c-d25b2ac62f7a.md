## Content

**Consider a person engaged in justifying a belief and required to provide an infinite chain of reasons. Intuitively, such an endeavor may result in epistemic paralysis, where the person becomes stuck endlessly seeking more reasons without ever reaching a point of decision.**, **It is plausible to assume that an effective epistemic process must involve decisive closure at some point, facilitating belief formation without necessitating endless reasoning.**
