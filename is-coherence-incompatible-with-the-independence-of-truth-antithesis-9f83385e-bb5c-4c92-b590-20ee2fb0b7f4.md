## Content

**A coherent system of beliefs can still be disconnected from reality and independently verified truths.**, **Take for instance a fictional world where all beliefs about a set of characters and events are internally coherent but lack correspondence with the actual world.**, **If such a fictional but coherent belief system is mistaken for knowledge, it suggests an incompatibility between coherence and the objective, independent nature of truth.**
