## Content

**Imagine an individual holds a true belief about an event being safe from falsehood, but there exists strong defeating evidence countering the belief of which the individual is unaware**, **Even if the belief is actually true and safe from being false, the presence of defeating evidence might intuitively prevent us from considering this as knowledge**, **A subtle conflict arises where the safety condition doesnâ€™t address how defeating evidence near the belief affects its candidacy for knowledge**
