## Content

**Consider a situation where person P holds a coherent belief system that includes a false belief due to circular reasoning. Intuitively, coherence alone does not ensure that all beliefs within the system are true.**, **Coherence might justify beliefs that are false or based on faulty reasoning, challenging its sufficiency for knowledge.**
