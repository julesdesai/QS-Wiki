**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a weather report predicting rain, which is false, yet it still rains due to an unexpected weather pattern. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know it will rain because the belief is based on false information.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot arise merely from coincidental accuracy; it should be based on reliable evidence or reasoning.**
