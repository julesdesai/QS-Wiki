## Content

**Consider a scenario where a historian believes an artifact is from the 14th century based on extensive research. Subsequently, new evidence is discovered, contradicting this belief, yet isn't available to the historian before they assert their knowledge claim. Intuitively, we judge that the historian's belief could still be seen as unjustified due to the presence of defeating evidence unknown to them.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot exist if there is strong, albeit undiscovered, evidence against the belief, indicating that current justification may be insufficient for knowledge.**
