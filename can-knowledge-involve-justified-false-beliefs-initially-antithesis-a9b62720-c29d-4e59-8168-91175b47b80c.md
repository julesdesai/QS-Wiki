## Content

**Suppose we have a cognitive process that typically produces justified true beliefs, but leads to a false belief that is later corrected as part of the same process. Intuitively, the eventual true belief doesn't reflect knowledge initially.**, **Knowledge seems to require truth from the outset, which challenges the idea that reliability alone safeguards against false beliefs in knowledge claims.**
