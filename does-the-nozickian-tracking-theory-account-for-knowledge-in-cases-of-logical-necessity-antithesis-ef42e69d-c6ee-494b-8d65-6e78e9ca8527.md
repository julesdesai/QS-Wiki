## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a proposition is necessarily true, then if the proposition were false, one would not believe it, because there is no possible world where the proposition is false.**, **In the case of a necessarily true proposition, the tracking condition that one would not believe it if it were false does not provide meaningful information about one's belief state, since the condition is trivially satisfied.**, **For necessarily true propositions, one could satisfy the tracking conditions even if their belief is based on entirely inappropriate grounds, such as misunderstanding or coincidence, thereby questioning the sufficiency of the tracking conditions for knowing necessarily true propositions.**
