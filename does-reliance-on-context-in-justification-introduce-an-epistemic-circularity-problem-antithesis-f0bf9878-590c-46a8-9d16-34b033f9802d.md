## Content

**Suppose someone claims knowledge of a fact with justification seen as adequate because of the context, but their awareness of that context is itself context-dependent. Intuitively, this creates a circular reasoning problem that undermines the claim to knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where understanding of contextual justification requires prior knowledge. Intuitively, such dependency questions the legitimacy of the original knowledge claim.**
