## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a reliable process implants a true belief in a personâ€™s mind without their conscious awareness of having that belief. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the truth of the implanted proposition even if they do not consciously hold the belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not always require conscious belief, especially in cases where a reliable process guarantees the truth of the proposition known.**
