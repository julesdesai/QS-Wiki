## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person forms a belief based on strong evidence, but unbeknownst to them, the evidence is misleading, corrected by a background fact aligning the belief with the truth, similar to common Gettier examples. Intuitively, we hesitate to consider this as knowledge due to the accidental nature of the truth.**, **It is plausible to assert that Gettier problems highlight flaws in relying on mere truth-conducive connections as sufficient for knowledge. This assertion underscores limitations in the sufficiency component of the theoretical view.**
