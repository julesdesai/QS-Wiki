## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a true proposition based on sound evidence, yet this belief does not contribute to any practical outcome or benefit. Intuitively, we would still classify this case as knowledge.**, **If knowledge can exist without the belief being pragmatically beneficial, then pragmatic benefit might not be a necessary component of knowledge.**
