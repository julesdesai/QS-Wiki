## Content

**Suppose a person has a justified belief but doubts arise about the justification itself because it too seems fallible. Intuitively, this could lead to an infinite regress, where every justification requires further justification.**, **The principle that knowledge should terminate in certainty contrasts with potentially endless chains of doubt launched by fallible justifications.**
