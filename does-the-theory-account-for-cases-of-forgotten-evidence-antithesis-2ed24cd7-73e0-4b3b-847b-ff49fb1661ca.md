## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition based on strong evidence they have since forgotten.**, **Intuitively, such a person might still be said to know the proposition, despite not satisfying the sensitivity condition currently.**, **The current lack of sensitivity does not seem to impair the knowledge that was once justified and true.**
