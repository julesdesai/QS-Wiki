## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person is reliably informed by an unknown, unreliable source that the traffic light is green, and it happens to be green. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person's belief is safe from error because it is true, or that the source could have easily led to a false belief. If we say the belief is safe due to its truth, then it seems we are allowing luck to influence knowledge claims. If we say the belief is not safe, then we challenge the necessity of belief safety for knowledge if intuition and reliability are not aligned.**, **It is implausible that safety alone without consideration of the belief's formation guarantees knowledge because it may ignore the reliability of evidence sources.**
