## Content

**Consider a belief that one accidentally forms through a causal chain unrelated to understanding the propositionâ€™s truth. Upon discovery of truth through fortuitous events, acknowledging knowledge seems intuitive despite conflicting with the causal requirement.**, **Suppose an accidental, uncontrolled causal chain results in a true belief that turns out to be insightful and knowledgeable. Yet, intuitively these beliefs break down under strict causal connection scrutiny.**
