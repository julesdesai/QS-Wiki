## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a true belief solely because of external conditions they are unaware of. Intuitively, we either have to say that this person knows the proposition or doesn't. If we say they do, it undermines the role of internal justification in knowledge. If we say they don't, it suggests external conditions alone aren't sufficient for knowledge.**
