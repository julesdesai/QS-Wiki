## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual has a true belief based on a unique insight or intuition that does not conform to socially validated beliefs. In this scenario, despite being isolated, the belief seems to qualify as knowledge due to its truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can sometimes arise from isolated insights, which entails that a belief does not always need to be socially validated to be known. This contradicts the notion that social validation is a necessary and sufficient condition for knowledge.**
