## Content

**In Gettier cases, a person has a true belief with justification but not knowledge, due to the role of luck or coincidence.**, **Consider a case where a person's belief is true and produced by a reliable process, but the truth is coincidental, such as a stopped clock showing the correct time.**, **These situations suggest that reliability is not sufficient for knowledge since knowledge requires immunity to such coincidences.**
