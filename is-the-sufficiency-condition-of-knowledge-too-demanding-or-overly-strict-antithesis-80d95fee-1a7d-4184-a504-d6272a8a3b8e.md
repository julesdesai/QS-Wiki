## Content

**Suppose a scenario where a belief is true and due to intellectual virtue, but it lacks one of the Triple A components due to an oversight that is insignificant to the truth of the belief. Intuitively, we might still attribute knowledge.**, **If the lack of one facet of the Triple A conditions does not necessarily preclude knowledge, then these conditions might be too excessive as sufficiency criteria.**
