## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is taking a reliable drug that sometimes induces hallucinations indistinguishable from reality, such as seeing a pink elephant. Assume the drug works properly and no hallucinations occur.**, **If the proposition “I am not seeing a pink elephant” were false, the person would still believe it due to the influence of the drug. The lack of sensitivity is introduced by the mere possibility of the drug’s effect.**
