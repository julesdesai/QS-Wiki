## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should exclude luck. This principle together with a scenario where a belief is true due to luck indicates that tracking is insufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a case in which someone forms a belief from a reliable process and tracks it accurately, yet the belief's truth is ultimately a lucky accident due to factors beyond their control.**
