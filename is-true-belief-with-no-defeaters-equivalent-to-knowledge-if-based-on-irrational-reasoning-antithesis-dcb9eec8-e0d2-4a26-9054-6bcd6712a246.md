## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition without any defeaters, but their belief is based on an irrational reason, such as a superstition. Intuitively, we might judge that such irrational reasoning undermines the claim to knowledge, despite the proposition being true and undefeated.**, **Knowledge intuitively requires not just any true belief without defeaters, but one based on a rational foundation.**
