## Content

**Reliabilism claims that if a belief is true and formed by a reliable process, it counts as knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person sees what looks like a sheep in a field and forms the belief "There is a sheep in the field," but the object seen is a dog disguised as a sheep, while a real sheep is hidden behind a tree.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, despite the belief being true and the process seeming reliable.**
