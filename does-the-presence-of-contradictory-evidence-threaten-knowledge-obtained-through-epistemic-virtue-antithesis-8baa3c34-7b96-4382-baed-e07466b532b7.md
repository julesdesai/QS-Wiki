## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief supported by epistemic virtues, but there exists contradictory evidence unknown to the person. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge whether the ignorance of the contradiction impacts the belief's status as knowledge. If it does, it suggests that knowledge requires absence of contradiction knowledge, which challenges the sufficiency of epistemic virtues.**
