## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition based on strong evidence, yet unknown false evidence exists that would have defeated the belief if known. Intuitively, the presence of such hidden defeaters undermines the status of the belief as knowledge, even if the belief is true and well-supported.**, **It is implausible that knowledge only requires the absence of known defeaters, rather than any defeasible counter-evidence, even if such evidence remains undetected.**
