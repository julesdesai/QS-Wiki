## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is locked in a room with no external input but develops a coherent set of beliefs based on internal experiences or reasoning. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the absence of any external validation prevents the person's beliefs from rising to the level of knowledge.**
