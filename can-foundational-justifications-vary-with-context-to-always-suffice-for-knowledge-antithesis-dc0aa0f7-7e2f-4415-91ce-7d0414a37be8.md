## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the belief to be based on infallible justifications. This principle together with knowledge requiring contextually foundational justifications suggests that such justifications are infallible, which is implausible.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has a belief based on foundation A in context C1, but the same foundation is unreliable in a different context C2. Intuitively, this suggests that foundational justifications cannot always guarantee knowledge across different contexts.**
