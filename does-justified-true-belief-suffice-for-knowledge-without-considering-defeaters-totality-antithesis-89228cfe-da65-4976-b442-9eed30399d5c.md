## Content

**Consider a scenario where some person P believes a proposition Q based on evidence E, Q is true, and evidence E does not account for all potential defeaters for Q.**, **It is intuitive to say that if P's belief does not factor in the totality of possible defeaters, then P lacks knowledge.**, **Therefore, merely having true belief and justification without comprehensive consideration of defeaters weakens the claim to knowledge.**
