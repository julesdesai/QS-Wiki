## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at a true belief through sheer luck rather than as a result of an intellectual virtue. In this scenario, intuitively we might still judge that the person knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must account for cases where a person simply stumbles upon truth by accident without an intellectual virtue guiding them. This principle together with the proposition that intellectual virtue is necessary for knowledge entails a contradiction.**
