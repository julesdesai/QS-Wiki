**A belief system can remain coherent while accommodating false beliefs, especially when revised over time.**, **Imagine a scientist holds a coherent belief system based on outdated data yet updates some foundational beliefs while others remain consistent yet incorrect.**, **If such a dynamic but coherent system is deemed sufficient for knowledge despite outdated elements, it highlights coherenceâ€™s inability to handle evolving truth sufficiently.**
