## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person reliably uses a source to form beliefs, but the source fails in a single instance. Intuitively, we would still consider the reliable process elsewhere as knowledge.**, **In cases of generally reliable processes, measuring sensitivity alone may not adequately reflect our intuition of what constitutes knowledge.**
