**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition if the proposition is true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they do not believe the proposition if the proposition is false**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief would not change if the proposition were to be slightly different**, **It is sufficient for knowledge that a person's belief is sensitive to the truth of the proposition across similar situations**
