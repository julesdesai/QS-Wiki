## Content

**Consider a case in which a person uses astrology to predict that they will meet a friend tomorrow, which accidentally turns out to be true. Although if the friend meeting were false, they might not believe it, they have no reliable process generating this belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know they will meet the friend.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the use of a reliable belief-forming process. Since astrology is not a reliable process, their belief does not constitute knowledge.**
