## Content

**Consider a situation where a person sees what appears to be a sheep on a distant hill and believes there is a sheep. Unknown to them, it is a sheep-shaped rock and a real sheep is hidden behind it. Intuitively, we judge the person does not know there is a sheep on the hill.**, **In cases where true belief results from false premises coincidentally holding true, such as believing a barn exists because a fa√ßade appears real, the belief does not constitute knowledge. Intuitively, such beliefs are unsafe.**
