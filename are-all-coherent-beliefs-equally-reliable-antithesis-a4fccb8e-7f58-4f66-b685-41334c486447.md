## Content

**There is a plausible principle that not all coherent belief systems are equally reliable, especially if built on different foundational assumptions. Intuitively, this variability suggests that coherence does not inherently ensure reliability.**, **Suppose we have two individuals with entirely coherent yet conflicting belief systems. Intuitively, both cannot be right, indicating coherence alone cannot determine reliable knowledge.**
