## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief is formed by a reliable cognitive process but results from a coincidental true outcome not originally linked to the process. Intuitively, we would judge that knowledge is absent due to the non-causal link.**, **A case in which a reliable process produces a belief that becomes true by coincidence does not intuitively equate to knowledge, despite process reliability.**
