## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone forms a belief that a proposition is true due to an intellectual virtue, and this belief is indeed true, but for reasons unrelated to their virtue, such as a lucky coincidence. Intuitively, we would not say they have knowledge in this situation.**, **If knowledge required only belief, truth, and intellectual virtue with no defeaters, then this scenario would count as knowledge. Intuitively, this is not the case.**
