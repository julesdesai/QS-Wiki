## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone forms a belief based on an intuitive judgment that has historically been reliable, such as a doctor's quick diagnosis. Intuitively, we either have to say the doctor knows the diagnosis due to reliable intuition or knowledge requires explicit intellectual examination. If we say they know, it challenges the necessity of intellectual virtue. If not, it excludes intuitive knowledge.**
