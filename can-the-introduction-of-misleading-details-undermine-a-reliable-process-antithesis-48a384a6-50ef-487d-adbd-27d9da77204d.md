## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a reliable process to form a belief, but additional misleading evidence inadvertently introduced does not alter the truth of the belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the excessive misleading information means the person does not fully have knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the presence of misleading information does not impact whether a person knows a proposition.**
