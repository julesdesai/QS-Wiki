## Content

**Suppose a person forms a justified, true belief based on an unreliable source, yet there are no defeaters in their cognitive process. Intuitively, it seems possible to have knowledge even if the source is not entirely reliable.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can exist in the presence of some unreliable elements if they don't present obvious defeaters. This principle together with a rigid no defeaters stance challenges this form of knowledge acquisition.**
