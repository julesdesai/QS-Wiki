## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition based on evidence that is contextually relevant, but, in a scenario where their evidence does not rule out all error possibilities, their belief is not justified. Intuitively, this seems to create a problem for their belief to be considered knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be insulated against skepticism about error in all contexts.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be justified if it cannot robustly address error skepticism across contexts.**
