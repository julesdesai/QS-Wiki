## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's belief formed through intellectual virtue varies because of different practical stakes. Intuitively, we either have to say practical stakes affect the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge, or they don’t. If we say they do affect it, then knowledge is not solely constituted by intellectual virtue. If they don’t, then we dismiss a significant intuitive factor in how knowledge claims function.**
