## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person resolves a complex problem through an instantaneous "aha" moment without consciously employing a reliable cognitive process. Intuitively, we might feel they possess knowledge due to the correctness, despite not meeting all specified conditions.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not necessarily require meeting all specified conditions simultaneously, questioning the sufficiency condition.**
