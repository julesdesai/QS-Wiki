## Content

**Suppose a speaker suggests a knowledge claim based on their manipulation of the context to lower the standards of justification. Intuitively, this manipulation should not directly affect the truth status or knowledge status of a proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that the robustness of knowledge should not be subject to manipulation by an individual's ability to dictate contextual standards, as this threatens the objectivity of knowledge claims.**
