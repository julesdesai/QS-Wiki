## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition because of a reliable source, and the proposition is in fact true. However, if the source had given one slightly different piece of information in a nearby possible world, the belief would be false. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief could not easily be false in nearby possible worlds.**
