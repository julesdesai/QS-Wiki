## Content

**Consider someone who believes a drug will cure a disease, and their belief is true and justified by current research, but practical application is hindered by unforeseen side effects. Intuitively, we would not say they have knowledge if the practical consequences are negative.**, **There is a plausible principle that negative practical consequences may prevent something from being counted as knowledge. This principle, together with the necessity for positive practical consequences, entails a contradiction or challenge in defining knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case where practical consequences alter over time, such as a belief in the health benefits of a substance later found harmful. Intuitively, knowledge cannot be constantly revised based on fluctuating practical consequences.**
