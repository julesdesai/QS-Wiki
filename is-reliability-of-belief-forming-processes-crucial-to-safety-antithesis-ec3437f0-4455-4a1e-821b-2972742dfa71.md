## Content

**Suppose a process for forming beliefs is generally unreliable, but yields a true belief by chance in a specific case. Intuitively, this belief is not safe despite being true.**, **An unreliable process producing true beliefs by chance suggests that truth in nearby worlds does not always follow, posing a challenge to the necessity of safety.**
