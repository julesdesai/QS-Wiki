## Content

**Suppose that for different people, the context sets different justification thresholds for the same proposition.**, **In one context, person A meets the justification required to know, while person B does not in their context.**, **This suggests knowledge could be person-relative due to different contexts, leading to a form of relativism about knowledge.**, **It is implausible for knowledge to be merely relative in such person-dependent ways.**
