## Content

**Suppose that Tom believes the proposition "It is raining" based solely on the weather report, which is generally reliable but occasionally wrong. The weather report happens to be correct this time. Intuitively, if Tom's belief is only based on fallible evidence, it does not constitute knowledge even if it is true.**, **Believing based on fallible evidence can lead to true belief without constituting knowledge due to the possibility of error.**
