## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a coherent system of beliefs, but this system includes at least one false belief that plays a crucial role in their reasoning. Intuitively, it seems that false beliefs, even if part of a coherent system, undermine the claim to knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that true beliefs are necessary for knowledge, suggesting that a coherent system containing any false beliefs cannot support claims to knowledge.**
