## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has always relied on a trusted friendâ€™s opinions, which are reliable. The friend tells them something incomplete but true, yet intuitively, we either have to say it is knowledge or it is not. If we say it is not, it implies reliance on process dismisses genuine knowledge. If we say it is, it suggests that reliability requirement might not be necessary.**
