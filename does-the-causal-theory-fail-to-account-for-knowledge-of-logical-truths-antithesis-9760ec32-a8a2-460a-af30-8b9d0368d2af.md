## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowing a logical truth does not require empirical verification or a causal relationship with the truth. For instance, knowing that "all bachelors are unmarried" is a logical truth that does not depend on external verification.**, **According to the causal theory, knowledge would necessitate a causal interaction or connection with the truth of a proposition. However, logical and mathematical truths are known without reference to external causation, suggesting a discrepancy.**, **If knowledge of logical truths requires no causal connection, this suggests either an exception to or a fundamental issue with the sufficiency condition posited by the causal theory.**
