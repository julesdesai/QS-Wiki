## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a true belief but is not consciously aware of holding it, such as a person who can accurately predict weather changes without realizing their own belief-forming process.**, **A plausible epistemic principle is that belief must be consciously held for it to count as knowledge.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that absent conscious belief, the person doesn't truly "know," despite the reliability of the process.**
