## Content

**Consider a situation where a person claims to know something in a casual conversation but not in a legal context due to the varying levels of justification required. Intuitively, this variation implies that the person's knowledge status is unstable.**, **It is implausible that knowledge should depend on shifting factors such as context, which can lead to differing judgments about what one knows at different times or settings.**
