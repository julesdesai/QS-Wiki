## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a belief is pragmatically necessary for success in everyday life, such as the belief in free will or moral values, without being based on foundational justification. Intuitively, the belief appears justified, suggesting pragmatic considerations can justify beliefs without foundations.**, **There is a plausible principle that practical reasoning provides adequate justification for belief in some contexts. This principle, alongside the case of pragmatic necessity, challenges the need for foundational justification.**
