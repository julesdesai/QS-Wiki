## Content

**Consider a situation where two individuals have equally coherent but mutually exclusive belief systems. Intuitively, we cannot claim that both individuals have knowledge, as their beliefs cannot both be true.**, **The plausible principle here is that mutually exclusive coherent belief systems cannot both constitute knowledge, since knowledge requires truth which is singular and objective.**
