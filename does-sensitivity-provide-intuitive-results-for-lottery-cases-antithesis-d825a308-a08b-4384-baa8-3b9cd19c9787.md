## Content

**Consider a person holding a lottery ticket who believes they will lose based on understanding the odds, yet they have not yet checked the results.**, **If the personâ€™s ticket does not win, it would make sense that belief was apt; however, they also hold belief when considering possibilities of winning.**, **Intuitively, it seems they do not know they'll lose despite high likelihood, challenging the sensitivity requirement since the fallback remains belief on losing.**
