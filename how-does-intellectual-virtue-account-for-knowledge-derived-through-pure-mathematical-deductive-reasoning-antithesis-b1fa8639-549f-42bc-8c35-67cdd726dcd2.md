## Content

**Consider a mathematician who derives a new theorem purely through logical deduction and abstract reasoning. The result is a true belief, yet the process seems distanced from typical intellectual virtues like open-mindedness or curiosity. Intuitively, it appears that this knowledge might be justified without direct recourse to intellectual virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that formal logical deduction and mathematical reasoning can produce knowledge independently of the intellectual virtues that justify everyday beliefs, thereby questioning the necessity of such virtues in all knowledge claims.**
