## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition based on robust external conditions that fail in slightly different circumstances. Intuitively, this calls into question the reliability of these conditions as indicators of knowledge.**, **Reliability of processes behind belief is necessary for knowledge, which external robustness alone may not guarantee.**
