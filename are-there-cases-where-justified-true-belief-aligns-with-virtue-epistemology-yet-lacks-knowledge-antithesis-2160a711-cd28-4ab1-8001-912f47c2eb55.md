## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is formed through intellectual virtue, yet their reasoning process has significant gaps unbeknownst to them. Intuitively, we would question the depth of their understanding or knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge rests solely on intellectual virtue without the need to also account for comprehensive reasoning or full justification of the belief.**
