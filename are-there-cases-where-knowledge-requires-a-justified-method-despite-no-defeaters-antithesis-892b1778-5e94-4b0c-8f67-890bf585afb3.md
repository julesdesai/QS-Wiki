## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition that is true and there are no defeaters, but the proposition is believed based on an unjustified method, such as blind faith. Intuitively, we might judge this does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible to regard a belief formed through an unjustified method as knowledge merely due to the lack of defeaters.**
