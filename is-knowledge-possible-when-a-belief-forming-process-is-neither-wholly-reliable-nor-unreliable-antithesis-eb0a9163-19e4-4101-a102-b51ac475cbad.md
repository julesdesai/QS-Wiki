## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief-forming process is reliable only some of the time, leading to both true and false beliefs. Intuitively, we either have to say that all beliefs formed are knowledge or none are. If we say all are knowledge, even false beliefs seem to count, which is counterintuitive. If we say none are knowledge, then true beliefs acquired reliably only some of the time are lost.**, **It is implausible to consider processes that occasionally yield true beliefs but aren't consistently reliable as sufficient for knowledge generation.**
