## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person perceives an object directly, such as seeing a tree, and forms a true belief about it without engaging any intellectual virtue. Intuitively, such perceptual knowledge can occur without intellectual virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that immediate perceptual experiences can yield knowledge independently of any intellectual virtues, challenging the necessity of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
