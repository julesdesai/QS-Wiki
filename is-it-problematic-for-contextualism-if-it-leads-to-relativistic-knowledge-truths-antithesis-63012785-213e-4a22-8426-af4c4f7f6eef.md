## Content

**Imagine a situation where person A in context X knows a proposition, while person B in context Y does not, yet they have the same evidence and justification. Intuitively, context alone should not make a known proposition relative in truth.**, **It is implausible for a statement to be both known and not known simultaneously simply due to the context of the knower.**
