## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a reliable clairvoyant ability leading to true beliefs about various events without any understanding of the source of this reliability. Intuitively, we either have to say that such a person knows the events or they do not. If we say they know, then we must accept knowledge without understanding. If we say they do not know, then reliability is not sufficient for knowledge.**
