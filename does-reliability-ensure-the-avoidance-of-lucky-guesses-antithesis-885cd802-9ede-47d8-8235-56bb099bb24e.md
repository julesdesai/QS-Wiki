## Content

**Imagine a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a reliable cognitive process, and the proposition is true purely by luck. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **A reliable cognitive process can sometimes lead to true beliefs purely by chance, without constituting knowledge.**, **For knowledge to be ascribed, the truth of the belief should not merely be coincidental, even if derived from reliable processes.**
