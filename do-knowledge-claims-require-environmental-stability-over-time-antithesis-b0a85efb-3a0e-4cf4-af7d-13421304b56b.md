## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a true proposition based on current proper cognitive functioning and environment. However, the environment is unstable, with sudden shifts rendering similar future beliefs false. Intuitively, ongoing environmental stability seems key to distinguishing knowledge from mere transient truth. Such instability questions the sufficiency of one-time proper functioning for knowledge.**
