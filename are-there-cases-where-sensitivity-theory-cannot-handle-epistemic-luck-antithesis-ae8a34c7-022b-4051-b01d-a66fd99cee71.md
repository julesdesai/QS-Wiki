## Content

**Consider a case where Chris buys a winning lottery ticket based on a hunch and believes he will win, even though he should not rationally expect it.**, **Intuitively, we may judge that Chris doesnâ€™t know he will win the lottery despite his belief being true because his winning is a matter of luck.**, **According to sensitivity theory, Chris knows he will win because he holds the belief, the belief would not be held if it were false, and he did win.**, **The reliance on luck in generating true belief poses a challenge to the sensitivity condition, as winning the lottery can be too coincidental to count as knowledge.**
