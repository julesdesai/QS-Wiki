## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses a process currently deemed reliable, but with hindsight, evidence shows it was unreliable. Intuitively, we either have to say they did not know the proposition at the time, or that knowledge is sensitive to future reassessments of reliability. If we say knowledge depends on future assessments, it challenges our understanding of knowledge.**
