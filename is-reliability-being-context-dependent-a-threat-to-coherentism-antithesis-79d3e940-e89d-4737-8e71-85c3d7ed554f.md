## Content

**The reliability of a belief-forming process can be context-dependent, varying based on external factors.**, **In a scenario where a belief-forming process is considered reliable in one context but unreliable in another, it is possible for a true and coherent belief to be formed through this process in both contexts.**, **If the belief-forming process's reliability changes with context while the belief remains true and coherent, it becomes questionable whether knowledge is consistent across contexts.**
