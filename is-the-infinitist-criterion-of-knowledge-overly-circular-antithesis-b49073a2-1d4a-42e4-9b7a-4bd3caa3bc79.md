## Content

**Suppose each belief in the infinite chain exists to justify another belief, potentially forming a circular pattern across the infinite sequence. Intuitively, a circular justification seems inadequate for genuine knowledge.**, **An infinite chain of justifying beliefs could allow for hints of circularity, where justifications reference back to previous beliefs within the chain.**, **If the infinitist condition allows circularity, it undermines its role in providing a non-arbitrary basis for knowledge.**
