## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge carries a normative value, implying a duty or obligation to believe or act upon a proposition. This normative aspect is arguably not captured by a purely practical coherence model.**, **Consider a scenario where a personâ€™s coherent and true belief leads to practical success, yet the belief does not seem to carry any normative weight. Intuitively, one might judge that without this normative component, the belief does not constitute true knowledge.**
