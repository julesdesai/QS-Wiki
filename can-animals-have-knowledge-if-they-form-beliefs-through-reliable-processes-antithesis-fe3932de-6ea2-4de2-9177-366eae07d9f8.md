## Content

**Consider a scenario where an animal forms a belief through a reliable process, but the animal lacks the conceptual framework typically required for knowing something. Intuitively, we may hesitate to call this knowledge because conceptual understanding seems relevant.**, **Suppose knowledge involves more than just a reliable process, such as a conceptual component. If animals form beliefs through reliable processes but lack conceptualization, this challenges whether they truly have knowledge.**
