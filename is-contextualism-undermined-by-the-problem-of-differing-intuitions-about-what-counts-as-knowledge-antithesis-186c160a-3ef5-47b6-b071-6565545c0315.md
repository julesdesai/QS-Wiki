## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which people are asked if a person knows a proposition given differing levels of evidence, such as observing a broken watch showing the correct time. Intuitively, people may disagree on whether the person knows the time depending on their understanding of contextual justification.**, **It is implausible to think that knowledge can vary so dramatically based on varying personal intuitions about context, as this suggests excessive subjectivity in what counts as knowledge.**
