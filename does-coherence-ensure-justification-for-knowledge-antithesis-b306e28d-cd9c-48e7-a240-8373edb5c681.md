## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a coherent set of interconnected beliefs that are all false. Intuitively, believing a false proposition cannot constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a person to have knowledge, their belief must accurately reflect the state of the world. This principle together with a coherent but false belief system challenges the sufficiency of coherence for knowledge.**
