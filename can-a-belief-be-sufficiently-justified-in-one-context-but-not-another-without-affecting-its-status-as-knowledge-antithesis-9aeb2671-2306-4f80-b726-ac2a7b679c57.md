## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief has different foundational justifications in separate contexts, and one context does not support the belief adequately. Intuitively, such a discrepancy questions the sufficiency of contextually foundational justifications for ensuring knowledge.**, **It is implausible to claim sufficiency of foundational justifications for knowledge when justification strength varies contextually and may not suffice in certain contexts.**
