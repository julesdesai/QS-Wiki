## Content

**Suppose animals form beliefs through reliable instinctual processes but lack any concept of reliability or justification. Intuitively, one might claim that animals do possess knowledge based solely on reliability, which challenges the human-centric aspects of knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can or should be entirely separate from understanding and justification, which are often missing in animal cognition.**
