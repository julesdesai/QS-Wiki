## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be transferrable or usable across different contexts. This principle together with the idea of contextual variance entails that knowledge becomes too fluid to function as a stable foundation for such transfer.**, **Consider a scenario where a person obtains knowledge in a low-stakes context and attempts to apply it in a high-stakes context. Intuitively, we would judge that inconsistencies in knowledge transfer indicate that contextualism fails to account for the reliability of knowledge use across contexts.**, **It is implausible that one could use knowledge effectively if it is susceptible to alteration by mere changes in the context of inquiry. Reliable action based on knowledge becomes problematic with marked contextual differences.**
