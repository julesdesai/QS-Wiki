**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that in nearly all nearby possible worlds where multiple methods could yield the belief, it is true**, **The unification of safety across alternative methods ensures that the belief's truth is not method-dependent**
