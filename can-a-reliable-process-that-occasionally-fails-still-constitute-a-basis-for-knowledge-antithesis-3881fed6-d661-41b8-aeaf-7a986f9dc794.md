## Content

**Suppose a process is generally reliable but has a known error rate, and a belief is formed during one such error. Intuitively, attributing knowledge seems problematic despite general reliability.**, **Imagine that a server predicts stock market trends with a 95% success rate, but a particular prediction coincides with a rare incorrect prediction. In this instance, relying on the prediction as knowledge seems unjustified.**
