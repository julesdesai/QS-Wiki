## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on reliable testimony, but there exists a hidden defeater, such as an unknown cognitive bias in the source, which undermines the justification. Intuitively, it would not count as knowledge because the belief could have easily been false.**, **There must be no defeated justifications for a proposition to truly be knowledge even if the belief is otherwise produced reliably.**
