## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person has an exceptionally strong justification for a proposition, their belief can be said to constitute knowledge regardless of the truth of the proposition.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has overwhelming evidence and justified belief that they will win a lottery, yet they do not win. Intuitively, we would judge that they did everything right in forming their belief, suggesting that the requirement for the truth of the proposition may not be necessary for knowledge.**
