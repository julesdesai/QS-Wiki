## Content

**Consider a person who believes it is going to rain because their knee aches, which previously correlated with rain. Intuitively, the person does not know it will rain just because their belief aligns with past coincidences.**, **The belief that it will rain may be true in nearly all nearby worlds under this correlation, but backward-looking justification questions the sufficiency of these conditions for knowledge.**
