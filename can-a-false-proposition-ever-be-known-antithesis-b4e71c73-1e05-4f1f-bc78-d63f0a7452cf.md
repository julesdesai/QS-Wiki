**Suppose we have a case in which a person P believes a widely accepted scientific theory that is later proven false. Intuitively, we have to say that P does not know the theory even when it was widely justified and believed to be true.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true.**, **A widely accepted but false scientific theory cannot be known even if it is justified and believed.**
