## Content

**A coherent system of beliefs can exist without any foundational beliefs by being entirely interdependent and without needing direct experiential support.**, **In a system where interdependence among beliefs replaces foundational beliefs, each belief derives its justification from others without a requirement for direct experience.**, **If beliefs can be justified strictly by coherence with other beliefs, foundational beliefs supported by direct experience become unnecessary.**
