## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a coherent system of beliefs that includes a false proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person cannot have knowledge of the false proposition despite coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth. This principle together with the coherent system of beliefs not ensuring truth entails that a coherent belief system cannot alone justify knowledge.**
