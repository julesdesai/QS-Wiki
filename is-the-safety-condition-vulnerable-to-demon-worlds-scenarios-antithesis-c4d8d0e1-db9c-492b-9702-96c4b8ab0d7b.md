**Consider a hypothetical scenario where a person systematically forms beliefs in an environment where most epistemically similar situations are deceptive, like a demon orchestrating false appearances. Intuitively, this seems to undermine the possibility of knowledge even if one ends up with a true belief.**, **In a world rigged for deception, even a belief true in all nearby scenarios lacks the safety needed for genuine knowledge, challenging the sufficiency condition of safety.**
