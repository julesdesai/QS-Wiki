## Content

**In scenarios where true belief results by mere luck, as in guessing correctly, despite meeting nearby world criteria, it challenges the grounding of beliefs as knowledge. Intuitively, this undermines recognizing knowledge in luck-laden truths.**, **Instances where accidental truths, such as discovering a hidden fact by coincidence, lead to questions about genuine knowledge due to the vulnerability of truth in alternate realities. Intuitively, safety is compromised.**
