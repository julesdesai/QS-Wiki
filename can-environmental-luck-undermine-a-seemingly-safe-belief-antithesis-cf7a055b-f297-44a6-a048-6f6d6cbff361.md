## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief about the weather by looking at a reliable source that happened to malfunction temporarily, showing the correct information by accident. The belief is true and safe in that similar situations would not usually have made it false.**, **Intuitively, it seems that the person does not genuinely know about the weather since the belief's formation was reliant on environmental luck.**, **Even when a belief is true and not easily false, reliance on environmental factors or luck makes knowledge attribution dubious.**
