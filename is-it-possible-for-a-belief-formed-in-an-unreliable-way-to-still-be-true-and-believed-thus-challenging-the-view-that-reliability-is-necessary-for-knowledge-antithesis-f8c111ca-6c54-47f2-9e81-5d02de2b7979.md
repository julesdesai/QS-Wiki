## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person sees a broken clock that accidentally shows the correct time. Intuitively, the person knows the time even though their belief is not reliably formed.**, **Consider the principle that for a person to know a proposition, the belief must be formed reliably. This principle suggests that in the broken clock scenario, knowledge should not be attributed.**, **It is implausible that a person lacks knowledge just because the clock is broken if the belief happens to be true and held by the person.**
