## Content

**Imagine a situation where someone believes a true proposition that is supported by evidence, but they ignore significant counter-evidence known to them. Intuitively, we would judge they do not truly know, as neglecting counter-evidence undermines their belief's support.**, **A plausible principle suggests that acknowledging counter-evidence is essential for a belief to count as knowledge.**
