## Content

**In standard Gettier cases, a person has a belief that is true and justified yet not considered knowledge due to luck.**, **Reliabilism claims reliable processes ensure knowledge, but cases demonstrate that epistemic luck can disrupt the reliability condition's sufficiency for knowledge.**, **Thus, reliabilism does not adequately account for or circumvent epistemic luck that disrupts assumed conditions for knowledge.**
