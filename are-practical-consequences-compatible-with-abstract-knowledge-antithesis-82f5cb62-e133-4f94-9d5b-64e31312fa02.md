## Content

**Consider a scenario involving knowledge of a mathematical theorem, believed, true, and justified, even when unrelated to any practical consequences. Intuitively, the absence of practical applications does not negate the possession of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting abstract knowledge can exist independently of practical consequences, challenging the necessity for practical outcomes.**
