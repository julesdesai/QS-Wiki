## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a reliable process must be accurately defined for knowledge to be genuine.**, **Consider a scenario where it is unclear which general type or category of cognitive process is being reliably followed.**, **Intuitively, lacking precision in defining what constitutes a reliable cognitive process threatens the sufficiency of reliability for knowledge.**
