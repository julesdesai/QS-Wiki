**Consider a scenario where a person acts successfully based on a false belief, such as a placebo effect resulting in real physiological improvement.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the success of the action suggests a form of knowledge, despite the initial belief being false.**, **It is plausible that practical success can be more pertinent than the truth for situations involving practical concerns.**
