## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a true proposition and has justified belief through strong evidence, yet their belief is formed from coincidence or faulty reasoning. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know the proposition, as their reasoning was flawed.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must not only be justified and true but also arise from a reliable method of forming such beliefs.**
