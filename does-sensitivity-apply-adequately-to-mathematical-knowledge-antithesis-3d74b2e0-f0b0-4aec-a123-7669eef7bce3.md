# Does sensitivity apply adequately to mathematical knowledge?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 3d74b2e0-f0b0-4aec-a123-7669eef7bce3

**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Sensitivity](knowledge-as-sensitivity-synthesis-1982e869-a9f8-479e-8278-4830b5b35ee7.md)

## Content

**In mathematical knowledge, consider the belief in the truth of a theorem based on a correct proof, which is necessarily true. Intuitively, we accept this as knowledge.**, **The sensitivity condition is inapplicable because there is no counterfactual scenario where the theorem could be false, and thus, it cannot be tested against sensitivity to a proposition being false.**
