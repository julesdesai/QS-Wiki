## Content

**Suppose an individual has a strong intuition about a mathematical truth, which is indeed true, but they lack any formal proof or causal link to the result. Intuitively, they might be said to know the truth without an established causal path.**, **Certain intuitions can strongly suggest knowledge independently from causation pathways, especially in abstract domains.**
