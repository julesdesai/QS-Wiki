## Content

**Consider a scenario in which Jordan bases his belief on a coin toss that correctly indicates the truth of a proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Jordan lacks knowledge, as the truth was lucky.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge is undermined by luck, even if it satisfies belief, truth, and safety. This principle together with Jordan’s reliance on a chance element implies his belief does not constitute knowledge.**
