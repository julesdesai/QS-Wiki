## Content

**Consider a situation where a person forms a true belief about the location of a friend based on seeing their identical twin in that location. There is no causal link between the belief and the fact of the friendâ€™s actual location. Intuitively, we judge that this does not constitute knowledge despite the true belief.**, **Cases like these, where a justified true belief lacks a proper causal connection, challenge the sufficiency of the causal connection condition for knowledge.**
