## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows that a horoscope fails to reliably predict the future, but they believe a horoscope prediction that comes true by chance. Intuitively, we would judge that despite the truth, this does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could result from reliance on a process known to be unreliable, even if the belief happens to be true.**
