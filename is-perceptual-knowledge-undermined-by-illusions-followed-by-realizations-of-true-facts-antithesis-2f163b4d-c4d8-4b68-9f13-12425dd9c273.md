## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person perceives an illusion, forms a belief about this illusion, and later learns the true fact fitting this belief. Despite initial perceptual error, knowledge recognition of factual outcome is intuitive, challenging causal demand.**, **Suppose a belief results from recognizing an illusionâ€™s impact, then noticing true elements supporting the belief. The stopgap causal connection raises questions about fulfilling knowledge criteria.**
