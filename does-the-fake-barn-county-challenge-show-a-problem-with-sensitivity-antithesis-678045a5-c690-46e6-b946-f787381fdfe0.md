## Content

**Consider a scenario in a region with many fake barns but one real barn. A person looks at the real barn and believes it is a barn. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows it's a barn because it is a true belief based on seeing the real barn.**, **There is a plausible principle that visual perception under normal conditions is sufficient for knowledge. In this scenario, the sensitivity condition fails because if the person's belief were false, the conditions for recognizing fake barns would lead to similar beliefs.**
