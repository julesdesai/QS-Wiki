## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a method used to acquire belief in a true proposition is reliable in the actual world but fails in most nearby possible worlds. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge because the method is unreliable in those worlds.**, **A knowledge claim should be devoid of any reliance on a method prone to failure in nearby possible worlds.**
