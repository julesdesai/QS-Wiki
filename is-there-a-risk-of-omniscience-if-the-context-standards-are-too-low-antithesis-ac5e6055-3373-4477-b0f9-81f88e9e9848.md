## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if the standards for justification are too low in certain contexts, potentially any true belief could be deemed knowledge. This suggests an overwhelming ease in acquiring knowledge that undermines the distinction between belief and knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person idly believes a far-fetched idea based on minimal evidence, simply because the context does not demand stringent justification. Intuitively, we would not judge this belief to be knowledge.**
