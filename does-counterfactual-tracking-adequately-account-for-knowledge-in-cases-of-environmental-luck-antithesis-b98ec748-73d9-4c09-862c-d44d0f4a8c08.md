## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a barn in "barn facade county," where all but one of the barns are mere facades, yet their belief in the existence of the barn is based on the one real barn they see. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A case in which a belief is true in a world filled with misleading evidence can still be a case where the belief arose from intellectual virtue, such as reliable vision, yet this does not seem to constitute knowledge.**, **A belief that tracks the truth in some scenarios of misleading evidence might nevertheless fail to counterfactually track the truth in all relevant nearby possible worlds.**
