## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition purely by chance, and no defeaters are present. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person lacks knowledge even though the proposition is true and unchallenged.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, a belief should not only be true but also reliably formed. This principle together with the unreliability of the belief in this case suggests the person does not know.**
