## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief by flipping a coin but happens to arrive at a true conclusion about a historical fact by sheer luck. Intuitively, we would have to say that while the belief is true, the belief's truth hinges entirely on luck rather than sensitivity. If we say the belief constitutes knowledge, then it undermines the requirement for belief sensitivity. If we say the belief does not constitute knowledge, then the sensitivity condition would be too weak to account for lucky true beliefs.**
