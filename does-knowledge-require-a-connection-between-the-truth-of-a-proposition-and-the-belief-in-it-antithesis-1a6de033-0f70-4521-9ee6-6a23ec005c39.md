## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone believes a proposition through a reliable process, but the truth of the proposition is unrelated to the process. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that for knowledge, the truth of the proposition should depend, at least in part, on the cognitive process involved. This principle conflicts with a view that prioritizes the reliability of the belief-forming process without considering this dependency.**
