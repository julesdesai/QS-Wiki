## Content

**It is implausible that an infinite chain of beliefs can provide an adequate foundation for knowledge. The necessity of stopping the regress suggests a problem with any system that seeks to derive justification through connected beliefs without ultimately relying on some evidential basis beyond the chain itself.**, **Suppose we have a case in which each belief is justified based on another belief. Intuitively, we need a foundational belief to stop this regress. If there is no basic belief, then the system is left unjustified. If basic beliefs themselves lack justification, the system collapses.**
