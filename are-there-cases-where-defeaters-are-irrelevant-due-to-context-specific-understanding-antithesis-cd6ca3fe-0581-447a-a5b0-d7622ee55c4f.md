## Content

**Consider a situation where local cultural norms provide the grounds to dismiss certain defeaters deemed relevant in other situations. Intuitively, local context can redefine knowledge standards acceptably.**, **If defeasibility is context-sensitive, it might contradict a universally applicable understanding of knowledge.**
