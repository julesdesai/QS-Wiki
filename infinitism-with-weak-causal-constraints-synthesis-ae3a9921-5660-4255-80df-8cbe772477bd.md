**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their justification forms an infinite chain**, **It is sufficient for the chain of justification to involve causally relevant chains rather than strict causal linkages between each reason**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their justification is an infinite causally relevant chain**
