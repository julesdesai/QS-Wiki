## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a belief that is coherent with all their other beliefs but is based on false or misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that such coherence does not genuinely justify the belief as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that genuine justification for knowledge should exclude beliefs based purely on misleading evidence. This principle together with the coherence requirement implies that coherence alone may not provide genuine justification for knowledge.**
