## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on a reliable process, but the truth of the proposition alters immediately after the belief is formed. Intuitively, it seems the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is plausible that knowledge cannot rely merely on the reliability condition if the truth value of the proposition is highly time-sensitive.**
