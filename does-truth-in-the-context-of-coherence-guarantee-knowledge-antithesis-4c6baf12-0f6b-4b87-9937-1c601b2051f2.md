## Content

**Consider a case in which a person believes a true proposition, and their beliefs are contextually coherent, but they arrived at the belief by sheer accident or through unreliable means. Intuitively, this accidental truth does not seem to confer knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a reliable connection to truth that is not adequately captured by contextually coherent beliefs alone. This principle together with a reliance on context-specific coherence may allow for accidental truths to be mistakenly regarded as knowledge.**
