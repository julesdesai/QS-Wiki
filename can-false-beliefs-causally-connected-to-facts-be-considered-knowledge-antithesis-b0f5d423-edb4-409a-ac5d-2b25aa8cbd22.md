## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a belief that is false, but this belief is causally connected to a real event or fact. Intuitively, false beliefs are not considered knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a causal connection alone can convert a false belief into knowledge, indicating that a causal connection might not be sufficient for knowledge.**
