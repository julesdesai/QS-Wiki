## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through properly functioning cognitive faculties and the belief is true, but the truth is only accidental. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **A person can hold a belief that is true accidentally, even if their cognitive faculties are functioning properly in an appropriate environment. This suggests that accidental truth undercuts the claim to knowledge.**
