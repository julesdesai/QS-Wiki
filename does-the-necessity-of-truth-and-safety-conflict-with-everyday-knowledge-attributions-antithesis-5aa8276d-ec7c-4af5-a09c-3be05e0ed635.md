## Content

**Consider everyday cases where people claim to know things that might not hold under scrutiny of safety, like knowing the location of one's car, where small environmental changes could lead to a false belief. Intuitively, we often accept such claims as knowledge despite potential threats to safety.**, **Perhaps distinguishing everyday contexts from philosophical scrutiny shows our ordinary use tolerates some element of possible error unlike the strict safety requirement.**
