## Content

**Suppose someone claims to know identical facts in different contexts with varying standards for knowledge.**, **Intuitively, the internal consistency of a person's knowledge claims requires a stable set of standards, not one that fluctuates widely across contexts.**, **Contextualism, by allowing highly variable standards, risks undermining the internal consistency of an individual's knowledge claims over time.**
