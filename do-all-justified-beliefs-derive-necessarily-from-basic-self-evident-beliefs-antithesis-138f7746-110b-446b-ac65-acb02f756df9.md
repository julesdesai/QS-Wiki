## Content

**Suppose a person justifiably believes a complex scientific theory, where the justification involves inference from various observations and not from any basic, self-evident beliefs. Intuitively, this belief seems justified without direct reference to self-evident beliefs.**, **It is implausible to claim that every justified belief must originate from basic, self-evident beliefs, as many involve complex evidential chains.**
