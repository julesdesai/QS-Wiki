## Content

**Suppose a person recalls a mathematical theorem they learned in school, but they have forgotten the proof. They believe the theorem is true based on their memory of it being correct. Intuitively, such a belief feels less secure than a belief supported by accessible evidence or proof.**, **For knowledge to be robust, it appears necessary for a person to have access to the evidence or reasoning supporting their belief, even if the belief was originally justified and true. Without current access, the reliability and security of their knowledge seem undermined.**
