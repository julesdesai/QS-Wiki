## Content

**Suppose a belief is formed via a multi-step process, where one or more steps are erroneous but the product is still a true belief. Intuitively, it is questionable whether this counts as knowledge, challenging the notion that reliable processes always justifies true belief as knowledge.**, **An error in any step of a process traditionally casts doubt on its reliability, raising questions on the adequacy of the reliability requirement.**
