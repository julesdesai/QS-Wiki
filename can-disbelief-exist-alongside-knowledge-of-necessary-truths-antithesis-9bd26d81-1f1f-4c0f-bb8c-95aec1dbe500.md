**Consider a person who understands a necessary truth like "All bachelors are unmarried men" but refuses to believe it due to a mistaken interpretation of 'bachelor'. This person can still be said to know the truth based on understanding alone.**, **A personâ€™s knowledge of necessary truths might exist even if they consciously disbelieve due to external factors or mistaken concepts, which challenges the necessity of aligned belief.**
