## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a true empirical proposition based on consistent evidence gathered through practical experience, like the color of the sky. If a rare phenomenon rendered the sky a different color, the belief might not change immediately without new observation. Intuitively, we might still say the person once had knowledge, even if current data isn't sensitive.**, **A case where a true justified belief in empirical knowledge lacks sensitivity due to unforeseeable factors challenges the adequacy of sensitivity to retain practicality in empirical knowledge claims.**
