## Content

**Suppose there is a proposition that requires an infinite chain of justifying beliefs for someone to know it. However, it is practically impossible for any human to hold an infinite number of beliefs consciously.**, **For any belief held by a human being, it is typically supported by a finite, rather than an infinite, set of justifying beliefs.**, **If it is necessary for a belief to be supported by an infinite chain, humans might have very few, if any, instances of knowledge, leading to skepticism.**
