## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief about a scientific fact based on a credible source, but they do not truly understand or comprehend the underlying reasons. Intuitively, either the person is merely lucky in having a true belief without genuine knowledge, or they might misunderstand entirely if questioned further. This challenges the sufficiency of a causal connection for knowing.**
