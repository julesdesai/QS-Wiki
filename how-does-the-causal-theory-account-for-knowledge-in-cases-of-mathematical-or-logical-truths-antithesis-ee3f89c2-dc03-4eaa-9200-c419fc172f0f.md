## Content

**Consider someone knows that 2+2=4 based on logical and mathematical reasoning without reliance on empirical causation. Intuitively, they possess knowledge despite the absence of a causal connection to a fact.**, **Knowledge of mathematical and logical propositions does not appear to require a causal connection to the fact making it true.**
