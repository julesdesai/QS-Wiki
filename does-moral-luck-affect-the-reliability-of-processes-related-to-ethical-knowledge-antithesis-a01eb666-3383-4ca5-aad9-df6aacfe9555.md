## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at the correct moral decision through a process influenced by biases they are unaware of yet is inherently aligned with cultural norms. Intuitively, we would question the reliability of the underlying process since moral knowledge is influenced by factors beyond empirical reliability.**, **It is plausible that moral knowledge requires more than reliable cognitive processes because moral luck and cultural biases cloud the ability to discern reliable from unreliable ways of knowing.**
