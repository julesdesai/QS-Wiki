## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person quickly and accurately acquires true beliefs about a subject through a reliable but passive process, such as a direct perception, without employing any intellectual virtues. Intuitively, this person seems to acquire knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable belief formation, even in the absence of intellectual virtues, can lead to knowledge. This principle will challenge the necessity of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
