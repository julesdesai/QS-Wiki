## Content

**Imagine a belief about a future event formed due to understanding current trends, where the event occurs as believed but due to unrelated causes. Intuitively, this appears to count as knowledge, challenging the necessity of causal connection.**, **Suppose a proposition about future conditions, based on a confident scientific theory, turns out to be accurate, lacking a direct causal link at the time. Such beliefs seem true and rationally held, yet conflict with causal criteria.**
