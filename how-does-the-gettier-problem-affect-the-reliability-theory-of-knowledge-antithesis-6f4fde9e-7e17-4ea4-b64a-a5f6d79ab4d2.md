## Content

**Consider a case in which a person P believes their colleague drives a Ford because they always see them in one, and this justification usually arises from a reliable cognitive process. If unbeknownst, their colleague rents a Ford this week, P's belief might be true yet lacks knowledge due to coincidental truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that additional true beliefs result from precisely reliable processes may not warrant knowledge due to accidental or coincidental truths. The presence of coincidence challenges the sufficiency of reliability.**
