## Content

**Imagine a person misidentifies an object due to a minor observational error but maintains a coherent system of beliefs around this identification. Intuitively, one would hesitate to say such mistaken identifications equate to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence theory can always handle simple perceptual errors often apparent in everyday observational contexts, undermining its sufficiency for knowledge.**
