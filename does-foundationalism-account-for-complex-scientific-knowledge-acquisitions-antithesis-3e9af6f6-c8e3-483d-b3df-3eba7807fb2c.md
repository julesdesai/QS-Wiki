## Content

**Consider a scenario in which scientists accumulate knowledge about quantum physics through collaborative and indirect methods. Intuitively, we would acknowledge this as knowledge even if it is not directly rooted in self-evident or basic beliefs.**, **It is implausible that such complex scientific knowledge is entirely based on foundational beliefs, suggesting foundationalism may not account for it.**
