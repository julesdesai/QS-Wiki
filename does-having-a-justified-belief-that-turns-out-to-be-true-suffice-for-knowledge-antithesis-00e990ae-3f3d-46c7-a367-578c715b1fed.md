## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is true and justified, yet the justification does not derive from epistemic virtues but from external verification. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or not. If we say the person knows the proposition, it conflicts with the view that epistemic virtues are necessary for knowledge.**
