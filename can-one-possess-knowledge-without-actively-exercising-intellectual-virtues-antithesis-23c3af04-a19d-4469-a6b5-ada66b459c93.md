## Content

**Suppose an individual holds a belief they formed years ago, when they did employ intellectual virtues. However, presently they do not actively engage those virtues regarding this belief, even though it remains true. Intuitively, one might argue they still possess knowledge despite their current inactivity of virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that past virtue-formed beliefs can sustain as knowledge even without ongoing intellectual virtue engagement, contesting the requirement that intellectual virtues must be continuously active for knowledge.**
