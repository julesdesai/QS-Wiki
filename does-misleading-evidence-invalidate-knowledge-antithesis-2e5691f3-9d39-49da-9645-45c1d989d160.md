## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition based on misleading evidence, such as believing it will rain due to clouds, while the rain is caused by a distant storm not visible to them. Intuitively, it seems incorrect to call this knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests knowledge requires that evidence must point to the truth of a proposition, rather than merely coinciding with its truth. Misleading evidence that happens to align with truth might not constitute knowledge.**
