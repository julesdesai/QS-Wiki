## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a reliable way of forming beliefs that are true, but they lack any understanding or awareness of how the process works. Intuitively, we have to say that knowledge requires some awareness or understanding of the process that leads to belief.**, **It is implausible that one could know something by accident, through a process they completely fail to comprehend, even if it is reliable.**
