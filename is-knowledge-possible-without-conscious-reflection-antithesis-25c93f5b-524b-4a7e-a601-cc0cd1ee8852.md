## Content

**Consider a scenario where a professional athlete performs flawlessly based on trained instincts and does not consciously reflect on their actions. Intuitively, we would say the athlete knows what they are doing even if they lack conscious intellectual exercise.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge does not always require conscious reflection or explicit intellectual exercise. This principle together with the necessity of intellectual virtue exercises questions the limits of unconscious expertise as knowledge.**
