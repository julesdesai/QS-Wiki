## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a true belief, and their belief is only indirectly connected via a chain of many events to the fact. Intuitively, such indirect connections may weaken claims to genuine knowledge.**, **It is implausible that distant causal connections maintain the robustness required for knowledge claims, highlighting potential inadequacies in assuming causation provides sufficiency.**
