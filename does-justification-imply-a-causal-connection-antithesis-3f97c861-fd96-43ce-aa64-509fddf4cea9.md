## Content

**Suppose Dana believes that there is a cat on the mat because they visually perceive it there. The perception justifies the belief and the belief is true. Intuitively, this seems like knowledge, suggesting that justification may itself imply a causal connection to truth via perception.**, **This implies that if justification intrinsically involves causal connections, an additional causal requirement may be redundant.**
