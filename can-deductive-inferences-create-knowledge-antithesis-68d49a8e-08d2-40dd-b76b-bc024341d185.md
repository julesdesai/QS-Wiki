## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person logically deduces a conclusion from true premises they know, such as deriving 'If it rains, the ground is wet' from 'It rains' and 'If it rains, the ground is wet.' In such a scenario, intuitively, they gain new knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that valid deduction from known premises yields knowledge of the conclusion. The sensitivity condition implies this deduction does not yield knowledge if an improbable error in premises still leads to true conclusions, challenging typical epistemic practices.**
