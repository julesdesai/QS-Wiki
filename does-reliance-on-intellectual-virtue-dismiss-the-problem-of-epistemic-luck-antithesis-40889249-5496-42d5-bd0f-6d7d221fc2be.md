**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtue should eliminate epistemic luck. This principle together with cases of epistemic luck persisting despite intellectual virtue suggests a concern.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person uses intellectual virtue to arrive at a true belief, but their epistemic success is largely due to luck. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that this is not genuine knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a situation where luck heavily influences the truth of a belief formed by intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we either have to say the person has knowledge or not. If we say they have knowledge, then epistemic luck undermines the sufficiency of intellectual virtue. If we say they do not, then intellectual virtue alone may not ensure knowledge.**
