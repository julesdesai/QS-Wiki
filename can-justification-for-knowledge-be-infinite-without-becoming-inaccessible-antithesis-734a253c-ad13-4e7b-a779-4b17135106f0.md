## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a personâ€™s justification for a belief requires an infinite series of reasons. Intuitively, it seems that an infinite series would be inaccessible to a finite mind.**, **It seems implausible that any finite being could ever complete an infinite series of reasons.**, **A plausible principle is that for justification to contribute to knowledge, the reasons must be accessible and displayable by the person. An infinite series cannot satisfy this principle.**
