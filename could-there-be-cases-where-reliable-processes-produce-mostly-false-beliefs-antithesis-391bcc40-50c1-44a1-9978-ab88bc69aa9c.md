## Content

**Suppose a process is reliable in a specific context, producing true beliefs more often than not. However, when taken out of context, it mostly leads to false beliefs. Intuitively, beliefs formed through this process do not constitute knowledge if they are false.**, **A process should be reliably truthful across all relevant contexts for it to constitute knowledge-relevant reliability. Reliance on contextual variability challenges the sufficiency claim of a reliable process-based definition of knowledge.**
