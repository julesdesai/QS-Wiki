## Content

**The notion of "nearby possible worlds" lacks a precise criterion for determination, resulting in ambiguity when applying the safety condition to specific instances.**, **Without clear criteria for what counts as nearby worlds, subjective or arbitrary judgments may affect whether a belief satisfies the safety condition.**, **The lack of clarity about possible worlds raises concerns about the practical application of the safety condition for knowledge.**
