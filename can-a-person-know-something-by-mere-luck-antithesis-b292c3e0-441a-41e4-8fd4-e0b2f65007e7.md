## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition and the proposition is true, but the truth of the proposition is accidental due to lucky circumstances. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just belief, truth, and reliability; it requires an appropriate connection between belief and truth. This principle together with our scenario entails that knowledge cannot be based purely on luck.**
