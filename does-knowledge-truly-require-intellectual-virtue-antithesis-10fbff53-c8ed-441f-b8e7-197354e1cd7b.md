## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief about the stock market due to guessing, and their guess happens to align with the information given by an expert. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know about the market trends because their belief was a guess and not grounded in intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a belief to be formed based on reliable grounds rather than coincidental accuracy. If the justification for belief in this scenario is not derived from the person's intellectual virtues, it challenges the sufficiency of this view.**
