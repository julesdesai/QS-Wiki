**It is implausible that coherence with a pre-existing set of beliefs without independent justification is sufficient for knowledge due to potential circularity in reasoning.**, **A case could be made where coherence leads to a reinforcing cycle of beliefs without an external truth-check, leading intuitively to a question of whether this can genuinely constitute knowledge.**
