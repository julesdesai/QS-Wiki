## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person claims to know the time based on a clock that is usually reliable. In this context, their belief meets the standard of justification for knowledge.**, **Consider a different scenario in which minor details change the context, such as the possibility that the clock was tampered with, increasing the required standard of justification. Intuitively, it seems that the same person no longer knows the time, even though nothing about the clock or time changed.**, **It is implausible that minimal changes in context can consistently lead to such dramatic shifts in what is considered knowledge.**
