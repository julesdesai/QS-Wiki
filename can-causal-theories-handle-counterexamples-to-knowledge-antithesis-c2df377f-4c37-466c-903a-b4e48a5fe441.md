## Content

**Consider a case where a doctor diagnoses a disease correctly due to a test result, but the test result was accidentally switched with another, incorrect one, and the patient actually exhibits similar symptoms. Intuitively, we have to say the doctor lacks knowledge even if, causally, there appears to be a medial link to truth because an arbitrary circumstance led to the correct diagnosis.**
