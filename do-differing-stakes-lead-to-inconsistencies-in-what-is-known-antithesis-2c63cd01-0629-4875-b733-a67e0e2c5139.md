**Suppose Emma and Liam each believe that it will rain tomorrow based on the same weather report, and it indeed rains. Emma has high stakes in knowing as she must decide whether to cover a planned event; Liam has no specific plans. Intuitively, categorizing Emma as knowing more than Liam leads to inconsistencies as both rely on identical evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be consistent among people with the same evidence. This principle alongside the idea that differing stakes affect knowledge suggests that inconsistent knowledge attribution arises.**, **It is implausible that varying stakes result in differing knowledge states for two people in similar epistemic situations.**
