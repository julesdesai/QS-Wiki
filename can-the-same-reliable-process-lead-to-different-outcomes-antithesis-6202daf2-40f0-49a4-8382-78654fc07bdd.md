## Content

**Suppose we have a situation in which the same type of reliable cognitive process results in a true belief in one instance but a false belief in another due to minor contextual differences. Intuitively, we have to say either both instances are cases of knowledge or neither is. If we say neither are, then we deny knowledge when the belief is true; if we say both are, we allow knowledge with false beliefs.**
