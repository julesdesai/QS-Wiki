# Is sensitivity necessary for knowledge in cases of accidental truth?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** dd343693-ce1b-44af-be7b-22797b7a4351
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Sensitivity](knowledge-as-sensitivity-synthesis-b95cfa68-70fa-4507-9fda-50da33c047b5.md)

## Content

**Suppose there is a proposition that is accidentally true, and a person believes the proposition with justification. Intuitively, if the belief would still be held if the proposition were false, the sensitivity condition would not be met, yet one might still say the person knows the proposition.**
