## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist holds a well-justified belief that aligns with current evidence but is later proven false due to advanced research methods. Intuitively, we might still commend the scientist's epistemic stance, suggesting that knowledge at the time was legitimate despite the proposition being false.**, **The historical context and available evidence might lead one to judge that knowledge can exist even when the proposition turns out false, particularly when belief is properly justified.**
