## Content

**Consider a scenario where a student in a classroom claims to know the capital of France is Paris based on the teacher's assertion, meeting the context's justification standard. A skeptic, requiring travel evidence, questions whether the student truly knows this fact because they rely on non-experiential justification.**, **It is implausible to claim knowledge of a proposition based on context-dependent justification if this justification does not align with an inherent and fixed truth standard. Contextualist justification may conflict with the immutable nature of truth, complicating what is considered knowledge.**
