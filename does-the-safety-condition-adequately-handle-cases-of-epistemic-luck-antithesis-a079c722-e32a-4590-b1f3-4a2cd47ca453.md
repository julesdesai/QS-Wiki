**Imagine Bob looks at his clock which reads 2:00 PM, and believes it is 2:00 PM. Unknown to Bob, the clock stopped exactly 12 hours earlier but it happens to be 2:00 PM as he looks.**, **In nearby possible worlds, had Bob looked at the clock at any slightly different time, the clock would display an incorrect time and therefore his belief would not be true, failing the safety condition.**, **However, intuitively, Bob's belief does not count as knowledge due to the lucky timing, demonstrating that the safety condition does not fully account for all instances of epistemic luck.**
