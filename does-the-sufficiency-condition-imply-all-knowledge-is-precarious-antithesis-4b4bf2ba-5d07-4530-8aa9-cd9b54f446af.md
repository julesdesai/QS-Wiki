## Content

**Suppose a person has knowledge of a proposition with defeasible justification, yet minor additional evidence can undermine their belief. Intuitively, this makes knowledge appear highly precarious.**, **If all knowledge is based on defeasible justification, then all knowledge appears to be perpetually at risk of being undermined, questioning the stability of knowledge under the sufficiency condition.**
