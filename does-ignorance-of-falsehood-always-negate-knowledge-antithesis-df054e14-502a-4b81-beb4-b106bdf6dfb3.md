## Content

**It is implausible to claim that ignorance of any falsehood related to a belief necessarily results in lacking knowledge. Many cases involve ignorance of minor inaccuracies where knowledge persists.**, **Consider a case where a belief depends on a chain of reasoning, one link of which is false but unseen, and yet the conclusion is true and justified. Intuitively, we might still attribute knowledge.**
