## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief through what they take to be an intellectual virtue, but unbeknownst to them, the circumstances are such that the connection between their virtue and the truth is disrupted by highly unusual environmental factors. Intuitively, we might say they do not truly know the proposition.**, **Reliance on virtues alone without consideration of external conditions might be sufficient for true belief, but not for knowledge.**
