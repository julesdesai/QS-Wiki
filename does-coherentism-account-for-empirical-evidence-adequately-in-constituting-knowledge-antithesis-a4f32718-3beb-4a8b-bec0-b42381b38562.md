## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist's theories starkly contrast with empirical evidence but maintain coherence internally. The absence of empirical adequacy suggests to us that the scientistâ€™s beliefs do not constitute knowledge.**, **Empirical evidence often plays a key role in confirming or disconfirming beliefs independently of coherence within a belief system.**, **Coherentism might inadequately address the significant role of empirical confirmation traditionally included in conceptions of knowledge.**
