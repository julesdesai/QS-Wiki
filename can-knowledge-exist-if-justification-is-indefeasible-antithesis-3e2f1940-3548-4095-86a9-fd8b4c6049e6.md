## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition and their belief is based on a logically sound mathematical proof. Intuitively, we would judge that this mathematical proof provides indefeasible justification since it cannot be overridden by any other evidence or consideration.**, **If indefeasible justification can exist and lead to true belief, then defeasibility is not necessary for knowledge according to the view which requires that all justification must be defeasible.**
