**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 299df525-f6ad-415c-9ecf-189b35c9eaf9

## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person intuitively arrives at a true belief based more on instinct than on intellectual virtue, and intuitively, this belief may count as knowledge. If intellectual virtue is strictly necessary for knowledge, such intuitive cases without virtue would be excluded, which seems implausible.**
