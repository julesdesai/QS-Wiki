## Content

**A plausible principle is that empirical knowledge requires more than mere luck. This principle, together with the possibility of acquiring true beliefs through sheer coincidence in different scenarios, entails that nearby-world truth conditions may be insufficient for empirical knowledge.**, **Consider a case in which a person believes a proposition based on a horoscope, and it happens to be true. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge, as the method of belief formation lacks rigor or reliability.**
