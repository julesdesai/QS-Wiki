## Content

**Suppose someone suddenly realizes an important insight, such as understanding a character's motive in film upon a revelation scene. This spontaneous formation appears as knowledge intuitively, yet infinitism would deny it due to lack of an existing infinite justification series, thus challenging the intuitive directness and validity of insight-driven knowledge without constructed justification.**
