## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person encounters strong misleading evidence that contradicts a belief formed by a reliable process. Intuitively, we would judge that the person should lose the claim to knowledge in light of the misleading evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that evidence should have an impact on retaining knowledge. This principle suggests that the sufficiency of a reliable process might be insufficient in the face of misleading evidence.**
