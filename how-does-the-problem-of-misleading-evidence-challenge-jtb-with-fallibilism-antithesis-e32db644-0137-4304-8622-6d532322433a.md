**Consider a scenario in which all available evidence points toward a false proposition, yet the proposition turns out to be true for unrelated reasons. In such a scenario, intuitively, one would not assign knowledge on the basis of the initial misleading evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that reasoning from misleading evidence that accidentally aligns with the truth should not count as knowledge. Under fallibilism, the role of misleading evidence is difficult to reconcile with robust accounts of knowledge.**
