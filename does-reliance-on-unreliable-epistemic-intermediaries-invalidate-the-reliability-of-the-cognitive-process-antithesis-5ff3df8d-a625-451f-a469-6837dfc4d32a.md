## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief by reading what appears to be a reliable newspaper, yet the newspaper is often based on unchecked sources or falsehoods that happen to accidentally match the truth. Intuitively, the person lacks knowledge even if the belief is true in this case.**, **A cognitive process that leads to knowledge must not rely on epistemic intermediaries that are themselves systematically unreliable or accident-prone.**
