## Content

**Imagine a situation where an individual holds a true belief intuitively, and their justification is external and not realized by them. Intuitively, they appear to have knowledge even if they aren't aware of why they hold the belief.**, **If a person can possess knowledge without conscious awareness of the justification, questioning whether conscious understanding of defeasible justification is necessary challenges the necessity of the sufficiency condition.**
