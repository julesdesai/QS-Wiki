## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief based on a rare cognitive virtue they do not fully understand. Intuitively, we would hesitate to say they truly "know" the proposition due to their limited understanding of the virtue.**, **It is implausible to assert that the mere possession of a rare cognitive trait suffices for knowledge if the person lacks comprehension of it.**
