## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition based on faulty reasoning, but the conclusion is accidentally correct. Intuitively, we would claim the person does not know the proposition due to the flawed reasoning despite the appropriate connection to the proposition's truth.**, **It is implausible that appropriate causal connections alone can confer knowledge when the basis of the belief is defective or flawed in reasoning.**
