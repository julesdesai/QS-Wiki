## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person dreams of a friend's accident, which then coincidentally happens. There is no causal connection between the dream and the accident, yet the dream was accurate. Intuitively, this does not constitute knowledge.**, **Dreams and hallucinations that result in true beliefs, without causal connections, illustrate situations where the causal theory does not adequately account for the nature of knowledge.**
