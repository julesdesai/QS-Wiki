## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief using a method that can be categorized under various levels of generality, some reliable and some not. Intuitively, attributing knowledge requires knowing the relevant level of generality, which is not specified by the process alone.**, **It is implausible that the reliability of a belief could be determined without a clear answer to which general category the process belongs, suggesting a challenge to reliabilism in specifying reliability.**
