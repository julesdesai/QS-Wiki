## Content

**Consider a scenario where two individuals discuss whether a bridge is safe, one an engineer and the other a layperson. Intuitively, the knowledge that the layperson acquires may not translate effectively to contexts requiring technical scrutiny, potentially rendering the contextual standards impractical.**, **It is implausible that justification standards, which vary by context, can always provide reliable guidance across practical situations.**
