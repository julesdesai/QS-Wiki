## Content

**Consider a situation where Nina believes a proposition based on solid evidence that meets all traditional epistemic justification standards. The stakes change, and suddenly, her justification's sufficiency becomes questionable, even though the evidence is unchanged. Intuitively, the alteration of knowledge status merely due to stakes is puzzling.**, **A plausible principle holds that if justified true belief constitutes knowledge, then the justification should not fluctuate based on changing stakes. This principle, together with the variability of stakes, implies that knowledge cannot hinge merely on justification accuracy based on stakes.**, **It is implausible to categorize someone's belief as justified in one moment and unjustified in another exclusively due to the change in practical stakes.**
