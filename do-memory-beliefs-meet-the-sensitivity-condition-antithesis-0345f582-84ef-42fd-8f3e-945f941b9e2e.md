## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where someone's childhood memory is vivid and detailed, leading them to believe an event happened. Intuitively, we either have to say they know about the past event, or we dispute their knowledge.**, **The sensitivity condition suggests that if the memory were inaccurate, the person should not hold the belief, which demands an unrealistic level of sensitivity to unreliable memory data. Such a strict condition undermines the epistemic status we afford memory.**
