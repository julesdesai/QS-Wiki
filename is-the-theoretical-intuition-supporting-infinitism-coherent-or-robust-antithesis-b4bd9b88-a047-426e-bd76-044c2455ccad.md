## Content

**A theory based on the necessity of infinite justification relies on strong theoretical intuition about epistemic processes.**, **Objectors might challenge whether this intuition robustly supports an infinite justification chain over other models, like foundationalism or coherentism.**, **Intuition failing to robustly or coherently demand infinite chains questions the justification behind infinitism.**
