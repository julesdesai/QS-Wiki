## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, but the belief is formed primarily through one intellectual virtue while others are lacking. The belief might align with the truth by chance rather than by a robust intellectual virtue**, **It is implausible to consider incomplete virtues or abilities sufficient for conferring knowledge because knowledge traditionally requires a comprehensive and reliable cognitive process**
