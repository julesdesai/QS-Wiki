## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person forms a true belief by sheer luck, such as picking a random answer that happens to be true. Intuitively, we would not consider this case as an instance of knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires more than mere truth and belief; it requires grounding in good reasons or intellectual effort, which is absent in cases of chance success.**
