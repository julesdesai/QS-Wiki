## Content

**Suppose a belief is formed by a cognitive process that is generally reliable but, in this instance, malfunctions and still produces a true belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person has knowledge or that the process malfunction negates knowledge. If we say they have knowledge, then this contradicts the notion that reliability must be maintained in each instance. If we say the malfunction negates knowledge, it raises questions about how reliability is assessed.**
