## Content

**Consider a case in which two people discuss a scientific theory. In one context, loose standards may be acceptable, and the person asserts the theory as true based on consensus without in-depth understanding. In another context, rigorous standards require direct evidence, preventing both parties from agreeing. If different contexts radically change truth assessments, knowledge can appear inconsistently across situations.**, **It is implausible that a proposition could both be known and not known simultaneously, as intuitively this suggests a contradiction in defining knowledge.**
