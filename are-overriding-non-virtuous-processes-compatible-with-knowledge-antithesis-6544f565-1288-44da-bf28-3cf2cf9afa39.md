## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is derived from cognitive virtues but overridden by non-virtuous processes like biases. Intuitively, it seems that such overriding processes undermine their knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that non-virtuous cognitive processes can diminish or eliminate knowledge. This principle together with the presence of bias entails that the belief might not constitute knowledge.**
