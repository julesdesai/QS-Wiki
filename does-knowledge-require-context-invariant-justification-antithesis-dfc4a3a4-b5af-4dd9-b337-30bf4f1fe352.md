## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a justification standard that doesn't vary with context. This principle, together with the idea that justification is context-sensitive, entails that knowledge under different contexts might not truly be knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which two people, under different levels of scrutiny, both claim to know that it is raining based on the same evidence. Intuitively, if justification varies with context, it is unclear which person genuinely knows that it is raining.**
