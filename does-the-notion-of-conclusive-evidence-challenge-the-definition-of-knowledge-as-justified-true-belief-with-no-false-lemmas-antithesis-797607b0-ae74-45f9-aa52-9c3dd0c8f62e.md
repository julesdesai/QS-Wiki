## Content

**Suppose two witnesses provide seemingly conclusive but conflicting evidence, one of which inadvertently aligns with reality. The accepted belief turned out true, justified, and without false lemmas. Intuitively, the uncertainty and conflicting evidence challenge the designation of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires evidence to be definitive and unambiguous. The presence of unrecognized ambiguity questions the establishment of knowledge.**
