## Content

**Consider a case where a musician has a natural ear for perfect pitch, leading to true beliefs about notes. Intuitively, we might doubt that this innate talent alone constitutes an intellectual virtue leading to knowledge, especially in propositions disconnected from musical contexts.**, **There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtues involve developed skills, not merely natural talents. If a person cannot translate innate abilities into wider contexts, these might not lead to knowledge.**
