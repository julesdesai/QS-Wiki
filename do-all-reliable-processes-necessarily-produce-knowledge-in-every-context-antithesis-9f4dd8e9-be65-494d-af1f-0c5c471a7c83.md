## Content

**Reliable processes may not produce knowledge if the context affects the relevance or applicability of the process.**, **Imagine a process that is reliable in one domain but is mistakenly applied to a different domain. Intuitively, beliefs arising from such misapplication do not constitute knowledge despite the processâ€™s reliability in its correct context.**
