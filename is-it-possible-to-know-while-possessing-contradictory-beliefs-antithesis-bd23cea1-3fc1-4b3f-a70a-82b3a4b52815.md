## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person P holds both a belief in a proposition and its negation due to different sources of information. Intuitively, we have to say that possessing contradictory beliefs disqualifies P from knowing either proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, mental coherence is necessary, with contradictions undermining coherence.**, **The simultaneous possession of contradictory beliefs suggests a failure to meet the conditions for knowledge.**
