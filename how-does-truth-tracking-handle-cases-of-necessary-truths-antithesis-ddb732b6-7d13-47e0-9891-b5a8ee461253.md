## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a necessary truth, such as mathematical truths, which are true in all possible worlds. In such a scenario, the condition that the belief tracks truth across possible worlds is trivially met regardless of belief quality.**, **It is implausible that a belief trivially tracking a necessary truth across worlds satisfies the enriched concept of knowledge.**
