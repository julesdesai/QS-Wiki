## Content

**A proposition can be justified and believed through a reliable process, yet if it is not true, it cannot be considered knowledge.**, **Consider a highly plausible proposition where all evidence points to its truth, but it is ultimately false due to unknown reasons. Intuitively, this fails as knowledge despite satisfaction of other conditions without the truth component.**
