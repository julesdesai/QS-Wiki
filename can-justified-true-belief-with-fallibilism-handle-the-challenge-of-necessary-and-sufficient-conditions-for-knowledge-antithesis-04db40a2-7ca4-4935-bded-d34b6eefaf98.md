## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition, has fallible justification for it, and it is true, yet intuitively, this belief does not seem to meet sufficient conditions for knowledge due to its fallibility.**, **There is a plausible principle that the conditions for knowledge must provide reliable pathways to truth, which fallibilism may lack by allowing true beliefs under risk of error.**
