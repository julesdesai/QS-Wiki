## Content

**Suppose an external force, such as convincing false evidence, intends to sway a person away from holding a true belief.**, **Even if the belief becomes sensitive—since it would not be held if false—this mechanism casts doubt on the stability and reliability integral to knowledge.**, **Beliefs that only meet the sensitivity condition under manipulated contexts question sufficiency for knowledge.**
