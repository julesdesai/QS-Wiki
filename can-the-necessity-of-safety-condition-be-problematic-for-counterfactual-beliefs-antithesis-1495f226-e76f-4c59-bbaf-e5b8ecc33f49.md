## Content

**The necessity of a belief being safe from error becomes problematic when applied to beliefs about counterfactual situations.**, **Consider a scenario where a person holds a counterfactual belief that seems true in the actual world but false in many nearby possible worlds. In this scenario, intuitively, we might still want to say the person knows the counterfactual proposition.**
