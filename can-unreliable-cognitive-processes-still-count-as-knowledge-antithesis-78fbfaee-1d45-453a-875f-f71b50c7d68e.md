## Content

**Consider a case in which a person consistently forms true beliefs through an unreliable cognitive process. In such a case, intuitively we might hesitate to say that this person actually knows those truths.**, **A process that frequently leads to true beliefs over false ones is called reliable in epistemology, thus it might seem counterintuitive to equate knowledge with mere truth-tracking if the process is unreliable.**
