## Content

**Suppose Jenny intuitively believes a bridge is safe, relying on engineering reports truly indicating this. In a nearby possible world, an earthquake alters the terrain and invalidates those reports. Jennyâ€™s belief might not be false due to her fault but due to uncontrollable external factors.**, **It is implausible to hold someone to standards requiring control over such external conditions, challenging the safety of belief as necessary for knowledge.**
