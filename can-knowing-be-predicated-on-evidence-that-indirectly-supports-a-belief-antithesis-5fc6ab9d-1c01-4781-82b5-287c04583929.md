## Content

**Imagine forming a belief from evidence indirectly related to the truth of the proposition but not the direct target, such as believing a suspect is guilty because they look nervous, where nervousness is more aligned with stress than guilt. Intuitively, this roundabout evidence seems insufficient for knowledge.**, **There is a principle that knowledge requires direct evidential supportâ€”the link between evidence and belief must be straightforward and not indirect.**
