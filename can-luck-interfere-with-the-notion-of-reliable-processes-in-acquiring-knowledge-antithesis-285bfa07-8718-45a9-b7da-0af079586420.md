## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes they will win a lottery due to a prediction by a psychic, and they indeed win by chance. Intuitively, we would not say they had knowledge of winning the lottery.**, **The belief that they will win is true, but the process leading to the belief depends largely on chance, which cannot be reliably credited for the knowledge claim.**
