**Suppose a situation where a person, Kevin, believes a proposition due to reliable sources, like weather prediction. In this scenario, Kevin would still believe the prediction even if it turned out false, because of unlikely-reliable sources' persuasiveness.**, **The elaboration of subjunctive conditionals implies knowability based on potential false turns of events. Sensitivity, by not satisfying relevant conditionals, struggles with adjudicating reliable beliefs versus unreliable beliefs.**
