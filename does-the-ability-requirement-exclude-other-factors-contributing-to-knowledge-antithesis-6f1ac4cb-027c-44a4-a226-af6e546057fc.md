## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be affected by a variety of environmental factors beyond cognitive ability.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is challenging to attribute this entirely to cognitive ability given complex contexts like misleading environments or luck.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person correctly believes it is raining because they see someone with a wet umbrella. If the umbrella is wet due to a spill and not rain, then other judgment factors beyond cognitive ability are relevant to assessing knowledge.**
