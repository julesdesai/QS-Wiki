## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, yet lives in a community where systematic deception is prevalent.**, **Intuitively, we would question whether the person truly knows the proposition due to an environment undermining belief justification.**, **It is implausible to claim that true belief in such conditions amounts to knowledge merely due to lack of personal awareness of defeaters.**
