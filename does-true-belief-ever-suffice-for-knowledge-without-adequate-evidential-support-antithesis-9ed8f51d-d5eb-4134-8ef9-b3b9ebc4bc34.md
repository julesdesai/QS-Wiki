## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a correct belief about a proposition simply out of guesswork, lacking supportive evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, as their belief lacks evidential basis.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief can be true yet not qualify as knowledge if it is not evidentially justified.**
