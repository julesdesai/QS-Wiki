## Content

**Justifications in ordinary epistemic practices are typically constrained by what is acceptable or understandable by a given community or set of norms.**, **If an infinite chain is required, the communal aspect of justification—where beliefs can be challenged, discussed, and understood within a culture—becomes irrelevant, which undermines communal epistemology.**
