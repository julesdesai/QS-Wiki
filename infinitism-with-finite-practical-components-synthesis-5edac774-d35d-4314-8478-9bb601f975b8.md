**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their justification forms an infinite chain**, **For human practical purposes, it is sufficient that a person can grasp a finite segment of the infinite justification chain**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and they can grasp a sufficient proxy of the infinite justification chain**
