## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a reliable process yielding true beliefs but relies heavily on memory, which is faulty. Intuitively, we would judge that the dependency on a faulty memory questions the validity of the knowledge claim.**, **It is implausible that faulty memory does not influence the assessment of current knowledge.**
