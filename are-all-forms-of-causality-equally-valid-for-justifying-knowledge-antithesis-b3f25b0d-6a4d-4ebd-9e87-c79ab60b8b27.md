## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a belief based on a deeply ingrained superstition that connects to a true conclusion. Intuitively, this is not considered knowledge even if causally related.**, **A plausible principle asserts that causal justification must be rational and systematic, not arbitrary or accidental.**, **It is implausible to equate superstitious or coincidental causality with legitimate pathways to knowledge, as knowledge demands rational justification.**
