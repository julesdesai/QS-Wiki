## Content

**In a case where epistemic responsibility depends on variable contextual standards for justification, it becomes unreliable or capricious to judge such responsibility. Intuitively, this compromises the assessment of who is epistemically responsible.**, **A plausible principle is that epistemic responsibility should not hinge on shifting contextual factors, but rather on stable criteria.**
