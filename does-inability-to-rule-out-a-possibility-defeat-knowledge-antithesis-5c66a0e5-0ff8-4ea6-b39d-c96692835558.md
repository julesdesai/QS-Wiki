## Content

**Consider a situation where a person on Earth knows they are not on Mars because they have never traveled there, yet they cannot rule out some remote brain-in-a-vat scenario where they are merely subjects of an elaborate illusion. This scenario suggests they still possess knowledge about being on Earth**, **A plausible principle is that radical skeptical scenarios are not considered relevant alternatives unless there is immediate evidence for them. This principle, combined with the view's necessity for ruling out alternatives, creates a conflict**
