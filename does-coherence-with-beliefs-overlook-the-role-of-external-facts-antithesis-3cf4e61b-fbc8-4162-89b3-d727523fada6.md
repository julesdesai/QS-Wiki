## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual's belief system is internally coherent and contextually justified, yet largely disconnected from actual facts about the world; intuitively, such a disconnection questions the adequacy of coherence for granting knowledge.**, **Suppose we consider a case where all beliefs in a system are false yet coherent and contextually justified; the lack of alignment with external realities suggests coherence alone might not suffice for knowledge.**
