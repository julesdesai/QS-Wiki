## Content

**Suppose we consider a person with a coherent belief set in one cultural context and a conflicting coherent belief set in another cultural context. Intuitively, we either have to say one set is epistemically superior or treat them equally. If treated equally, then context seems to limit coherence's capacity to differentiate between true knowledge and mere belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence should help in distinguishing knowledge from mere true belief, but allowing context to dictate coherence seems to undermine this capacity.**
