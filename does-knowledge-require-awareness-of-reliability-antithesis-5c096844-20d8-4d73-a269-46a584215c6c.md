## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on a highly sophisticated scientific device they do not understand. The device is objectively reliable for providing true information, yet the person lacks insight into how reliability is achieved. In this scenario, intuitively, it seems hard to deem the person knowledgeable, as they are unaware of the process's reliability.**
