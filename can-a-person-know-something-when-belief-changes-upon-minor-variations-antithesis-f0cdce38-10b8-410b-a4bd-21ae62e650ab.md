## Content

**Suppose there is a person who believes a true proposition based on seeing a distinctive bird species but would not believe it if the bird were slightly less colorful. Intuitively, this person's belief is sensitive, but fragile belief shifts suggest they do not have knowledge.**, **There is a reasonable principle that knowledge should remain stable against minor environmental changes, which sensitivity does not ensure.**
