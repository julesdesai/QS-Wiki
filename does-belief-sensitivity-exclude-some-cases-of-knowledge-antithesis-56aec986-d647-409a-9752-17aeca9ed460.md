**Consider a scenario where a person has a true belief about a distant event based on trustworthy but incomplete reports, making the belief not sensitive to the truth.**, **In this case, intuitively, we might judge that the person knows about the event despite the lack of sensitivity because they have good reasons to trust the reports.**
