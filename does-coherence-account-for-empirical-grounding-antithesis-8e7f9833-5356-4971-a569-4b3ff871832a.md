## Content

**Consider a person whose belief system is coherent but entirely lacking empirical grounding in the external world. Intuitively, empirical grounding is necessary for true knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that empirical evidence is integral for knowledge. This principle together with ungrounded coherent beliefs questions coherence's sufficiency for knowledge.**
