**A case in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the person has justification for the belief, yet some of their justification rests on a false belief, still seems like a case of knowledge to us.**, **In scenarios where the person has fallible yet overall robust evidence leading to a true belief, we often still want to say they have knowledge despite some of the evidence being mistaken.**
