## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief that is true and through intellectual virtue, but subsequently gains access to evidence that contradicts their belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that they maintain knowledge due to their original virtuous acquisition, or that the new evidence undermines their knowledge. If we say it undermines knowledge, then acquisition through virtue initially does not ensure retention of knowledge.**
