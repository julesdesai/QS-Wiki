## Content

**A belief's counterfactual sensitivity implies that it would change given potential new, reliable evidence.**, **For knowledge, a belief must be sensitive to the conditions under which it is held.**, **If a belief's robustness in the face of potential counterfactual situations is a requisite, then the lack of such sensitivity challenges the notion of it constituting knowledge.**
