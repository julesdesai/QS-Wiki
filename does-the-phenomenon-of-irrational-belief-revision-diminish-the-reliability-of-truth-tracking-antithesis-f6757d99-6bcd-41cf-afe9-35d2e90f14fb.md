## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person revises their beliefs irrationally yet maintains truth-tracking abilities. Intuitively, this seems inconsistent with our concepts of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that rational belief revision is integral to maintaining knowledge. Irrational processes undermine the credibility of truth-tracking as sufficient for knowledge.**
