## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person consistently forms true beliefs by using a skillful but unreliable guessing method. Intuitively, we either have to say that this guessing is an intellectual virtue or it is not. If we say it is an intellectual virtue, then even unreliable methods can count as knowledge if they accidentally produce true beliefs. If we say it is not an intellectual virtue, then merely being skillful is not enough for intellectual virtue.**
