## Content

**A belief's safety from error in nearby possible worlds is difficult to define precisely due to the vagueness of what counts as 'nearby worlds'.**, **Consider a scenario where different people have differing intuitions about what counts as a nearby possible world. In such a scenario, this leads to inconsistent judgments of whether a belief is safe.**
