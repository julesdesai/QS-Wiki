## Content

**A situation exists where a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the person has strong, but not infallible, external justification for the belief.**, **It is plausible to think that such a person knows the proposition due to the strength of their evidence.**, **The claim that knowledge requires infallible external justification implies that knowledge is not present in this situation, which challenges common intuitions about knowledge.**
