## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief arises from what is considered an intellectual virtue in one culture but not in another. Intuitively, we might be reluctant to attribute knowledge universally if the criteria for intellectual virtue are culturally contingent.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should maintain consistency across contexts. If intellectual virtues vary across cultures, then their role in constituting knowledge may contradict this principle.**
