## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition that is true only in specific contexts, like linguistic or cultural beliefs that vary globally. Intuitively, one might question whether this constitutes true knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge to be genuine, the truth of the proposition must be universally applicable rather than context-specific.**
