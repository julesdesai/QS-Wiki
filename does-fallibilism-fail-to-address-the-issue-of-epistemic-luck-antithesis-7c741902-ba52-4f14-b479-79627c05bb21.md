## Content

**Consider a situation where a person forms a belief based on faulty reasoning, but the belief turns out to be true due to luck. The intuition in such a situation suggests the person's knowledge is undermined by epistemic luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not merely be the result of happenstance or luck, which is potentially abundant under fallibilism.**
