## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person gathers information from an unreliable source, yet the belief formed is true and coherent with their existing beliefs. We would intuitively judge that such a person does not know the proposition.**, **Even a true belief that coheres with a belief system could be based on an unreliable source, undermining the knowledge claim.**, **It is implausible that coherence with a belief system suffices for knowledge if the source of belief is unreliable.**
