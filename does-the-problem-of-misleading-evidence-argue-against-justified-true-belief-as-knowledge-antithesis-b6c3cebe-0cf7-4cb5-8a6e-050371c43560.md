## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person justifiably believes a news report claiming an event happened, but the event did not occur, and the report was incorrect. Later, coincidentally, another event matching the description occurs, and the initial belief happens to be true. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite having justified true belief because the initial evidence was misleading.**
