## Content

**It is implausible that reliability can justify itself without leading to circular reasoning, as stating that a process is reliable might itself require justification based on another process.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification must avoid circularity to provide genuine knowledge. This principle together with the need for reliable processes suggests that the externalist account might struggle to non-circularly establish such reliability.**
