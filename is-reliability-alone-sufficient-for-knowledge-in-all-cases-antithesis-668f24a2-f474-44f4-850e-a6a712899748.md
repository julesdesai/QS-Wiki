## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a reliable cognitive process systematically leads to true beliefs in one domain but fails in another. Intuitively, we either have to say the process is domain-specific or not always reliable. If not always reliable, then reliability alone is insufficient for knowledge in all cases.**, **It is implausible to consider a cognitive process completely reliable if it can only produce true beliefs in specific conditions.**
