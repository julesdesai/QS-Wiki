## Content

**Suppose a person believes it is raining outside, their belief is coherent with their weather-related beliefs, and it is in fact raining.**, **Assume the person formed this belief based on reading an unreliable weather site, which happened to be correct this time.**, **Intuitively, we judge that it was luck rather than knowledge that led to the true belief, suggesting coherence and truth are not always sufficient.**
