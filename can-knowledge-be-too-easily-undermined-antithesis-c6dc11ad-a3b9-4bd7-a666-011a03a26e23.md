## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires stability against error.**, **Imagine a person who forms a correct belief about the weather based on a usually reliable forecast, but the forecast was actually a lucky guess this time. In this scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the belief could easily have been false and thus it is unstable.**
