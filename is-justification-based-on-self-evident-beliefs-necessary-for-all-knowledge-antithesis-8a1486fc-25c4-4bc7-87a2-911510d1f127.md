## Content

**Suppose a person has perceptual knowledge about their environment, such as knowing it is raining by seeing rain, without consciously accessing any self-evident beliefs. Intuitively, such perceptual knowledge does not appear to rely on self-evidence.**, **It is implausible to hold that perceptually justified beliefs require grounding in separate, self-evident foundational beliefs.**
