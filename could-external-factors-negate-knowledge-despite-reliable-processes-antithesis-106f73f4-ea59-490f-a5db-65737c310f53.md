## Content

**There is a plausible principle that external factors or forces affecting the reliability of a process can render genuine beliefs formed by the process deficient in knowledge. This principle together with reliance on stable environments suggests that regardless of internal reliability, knowledge claims are vulnerable to external intervention.**, **Consider a scenario where a natural disaster disrupts an ordinarily reliable communication system, yet a person maintains belief in reported news which turns out partially true by accidental alignment with events post-disruption. Intuitively, this discrepancy invites doubt about knowledge veracity.**, **Knowledge claims must capture the interaction between reliability and environmental stability to avoid undermining reliability with external alteration.**
