## Content

**A belief may cohere with a system but still be true merely by coincidence.**, **Imagine a person whose beliefs accidentally align with reality due to an unknown hidden factor causing coherence, such as random alignment of beliefs with evidence not accessible to them, this coherence seems accidental.**, **If coincidental truths within a coherent set are considered knowledge, this suggests that coherence fails as a sufficient condition for knowledge.**
