## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees an object and correctly believes it is a tree, even though nearby possible worlds include illusions or mirages making such recognition unreliable. Intuitively, one might say the person knows it is a tree.**, **If knowledge requires safety from error, scenarios involving everyday perception could fail the safety condition.**, **Safety requirements might unnecessarily discount perceptual knowledge, which is typically considered robust in real-world tracking of truth.**
