## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms the belief that there are cookies in the jar because they saw their roommate put them there. In a casual context among friends, intuitively, we would judge this belief as knowledge. However, in a high-stakes context, like a health-conscious meet-up, the same evidence might not suffice for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that if the same evidence supports different knowledge claims depending on context-specific standards, then justification lacks stability; this suggests an inconsistency that challenges context-dependent justifications.**
