## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a reliable cognitive process, but is unknowingly subject to a deception. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge.**, **A child, whose beliefs are consistently true due to luck and not understanding, still fails to know the propositions despite reliability. Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge in this case.**
