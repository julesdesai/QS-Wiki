## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that a particular stock price will rise, and their belief is based on inside information which turns out to be true, meeting justification in one context but not another. Intuitively, whether this person knows the stock price will rise should not vary with context.**, **There is a plausible principle that the truth conditions for knowledge should remain constant regardless of external factors such as changing conversational contexts. This principle together with the variability of justification entails that knowledge can shift without altering belief or truth, which is implausible.**
