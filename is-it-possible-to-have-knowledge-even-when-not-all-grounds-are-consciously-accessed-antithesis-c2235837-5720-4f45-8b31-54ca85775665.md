## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a person can still be said to know even if they cannot explicitly list all the grounds, provided the belief is formed reliably and is true.**, **Suppose a person intuitively grasps a proposition based on multiple subliminal cues, unknowingly relying on some that are false. Our intuition would judge that the individual still knows the proposition.**
