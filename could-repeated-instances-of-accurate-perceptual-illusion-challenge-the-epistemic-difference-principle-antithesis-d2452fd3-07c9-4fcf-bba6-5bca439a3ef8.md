## Content

**Consider consistent illusion experiences that lead to accurate judgments, such as optical illusions that provide knowledge about perceptual limitations. Intuitively, these consistent outcomes may be seen as possessing the same epistemic status as genuine instances.**, **Regularity in illusory outcomes producing true insights challenges the assertion that genuine perceptual experiences possess inherently different epistemic status.**
