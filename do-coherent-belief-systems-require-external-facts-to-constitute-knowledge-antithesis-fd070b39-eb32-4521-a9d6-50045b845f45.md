## Content

**A coherent belief system may not necessarily correlate with external facts but still appear internally justified. Intuitively, we would judge that a belief system also needs to reflect external facts to constitute true knowledge.**, **Knowledge requires more than internal coherence; it must also involve correspondence with external reality, suggesting coherence is insufficient on its own.**
