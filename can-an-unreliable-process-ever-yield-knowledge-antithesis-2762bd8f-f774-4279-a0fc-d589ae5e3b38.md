## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge is incompatible with beliefs generated by unreliable processes.**, **Suppose a case where an unreliable process somehow leads to a true belief about a complex, non-intuitive proposition.**, **Intuitively, it seems incorrect to categorize the resulting true belief as knowledge, undermining the sufficiency of reliability.**
