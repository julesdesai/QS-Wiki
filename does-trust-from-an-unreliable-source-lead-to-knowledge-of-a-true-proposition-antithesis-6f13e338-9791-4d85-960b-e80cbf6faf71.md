## Content

**Consider a case where a person trusts a notoriously unreliable source, which by chance conveys a true proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition despite its truth because the source is generally untrustworthy.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be derived from a source lacking credibility, even if by coincidence the information provided happens to be true.**
