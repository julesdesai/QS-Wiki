## Content

**Consider a scenario where a change in conversation moves a belief from being unjustified to justified knowledge. In this scenario, it intuitively blurs the line between belief and knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be distinct from belief, primarily through justification that does not vary with context.**, **It is implausible that knowledge should be so fluid as to converge with mere belief through conversational shifts.**
