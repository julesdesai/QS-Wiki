## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the standards for determining knowledge should be objective and not vary with subjective conversational contexts. This principle together with the contextual variability of standards challenges the reliability and consistency of knowledge assessments.**, **It is implausible that subjective conversational cues are adequate for establishing the truth conditions of knowledge claims.**, **Suppose we have a case in which two people engage in different conversations about the same event with different stakes. Intuitively, we either have to say that what one knows differs from what the other knows, or that both should be consistent. If we say knowledge varies, we risk subjectivity. If we say knowledge should be consistent, then contextualism faces a challenge.**
