## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based entirely on intuitively correct and true premises, yet they are unaware of a hidden variable affecting the truth of the proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not possess knowledge because the understanding depends on comprehending all variables.**, **A case where a person constructs a true belief based on an incomplete understanding of a situation reveals that additional non-false lemmas can still result in a lack of knowledge.**, **Suppose a person believes a true proposition, relies on true premises, yet derives it through a complex inferential chain that masks the improbability of the conclusion. Intuitively, we do not attribute knowledge to such beliefs despite the absence of false lemmas because the probability structure is not transparent.**
