## Content

**Consider a scenario involving the closure principle, which states that if you know one proposition, and you know it entails a second, then you should know the second as well. Intuitively, if all knowledge requires endless chains of reasons, this could disrupt the preservation of knowledge across many linked propositions, as endless chains for each proposition might not coherently align.**
