## Content

**Suppose a person, Eve, forms a belief that there is a barn, based on seeing what looks like a barn, when in fact it is a barn facade and only by coincidence is there another real barn hidden behind it. Intuitively, we judge that Eve does not know there is a barn, even if her belief was formed through a perceptual skill, an intellectual virtue.**, **Gettier-style cases show that having a belief formed by intellectual virtue which coincidentally happens to be true, does not necessarily grant knowledge.**
