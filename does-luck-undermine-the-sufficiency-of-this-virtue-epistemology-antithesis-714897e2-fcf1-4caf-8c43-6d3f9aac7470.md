## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person’s belief happens to be true due to uncontrollable external factors. Intuitively, claiming such a belief is knowledge is problematic.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a belief's truth depends on chance external to intellectual virtues, it should not be considered knowledge. This principle creates a tension with the view’s sufficiency claim.**
