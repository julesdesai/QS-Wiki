## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a reliable cognitive process yields true beliefs in one physical environment but not in another. Intuitively, we either have to say the reliability of the process is environment-dependent, or that knowledge is inconsistent across contexts. If we say knowledge fluctuates based on environment, this challenges the universality of the claim to knowledge.**
