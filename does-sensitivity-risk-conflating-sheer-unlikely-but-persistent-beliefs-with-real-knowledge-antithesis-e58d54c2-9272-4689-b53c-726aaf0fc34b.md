## Content

**Neil believes strongly in implausible UFO visitation despite countless contrary facts, owing to experiential bias or societal influence. If an anomalous event momentarily seems to validate this belief despite insubstantial coherence, the belief wouldnâ€™t change, reflecting how anchor bias leads to false corroborations. Intuitively, Neil's belief lacks credibility unduly heightening the sensitivity priority over genuine epistemic judgments. Proper assessment of likelihood vs. improbability nuances deflected by sensory interpretation dictates further room for understanding outside of rigid context
