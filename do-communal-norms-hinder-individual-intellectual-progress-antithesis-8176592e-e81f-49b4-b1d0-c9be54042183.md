## Content

**In some scenarios, communal epistemic norms may be conservative or resistant to new ideas from individual thinkers. Intuitively, this resistance may prevent new knowledge even if the individual has a true and justified belief.**, **It is implausible to consider communal norms as necessary for all knowledge, as they may obstruct innovative insights that don't initially align with societal practices.**
