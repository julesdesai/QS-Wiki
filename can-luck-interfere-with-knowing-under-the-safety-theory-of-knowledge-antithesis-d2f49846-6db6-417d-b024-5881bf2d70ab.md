## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition because of an event that is purely coincidental, yet in nearby possible worlds, the belief is still true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows or does not know this proposition. If we say they know, then it implies that luck can contribute to knowledge, which is implausible. If we say they do not know, then safety is not sufficient for knowledge.**
