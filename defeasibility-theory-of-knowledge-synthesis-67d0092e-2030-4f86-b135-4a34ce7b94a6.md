**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that there are no true propositions that would defeat their justification if added to the scenario**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and no defeaters exist**
