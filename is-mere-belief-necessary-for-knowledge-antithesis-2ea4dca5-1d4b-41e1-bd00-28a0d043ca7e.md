## Content

**It is possible for a person to have knowledge of a proposition without actually holding a belief about that proposition.**, **For example, imagine someone with a cognitive condition that causes them to act and reason as if a proposition is true without consciously believing it. Intuitively, we might still credit this person with knowledge if they reliably act correctly based on this proposition.**
