## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows a proposition in one context because of foundational justification, but in a more demanding context, the same justification is insufficient. Intuitively, this suggests that contextually foundational justifications might not always be sufficient for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that sufficiency for knowledge should not be context-sensitive, and foundational justifications being context-sensitive challenges this principle.**
