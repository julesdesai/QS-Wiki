## Content

**In a classic Gettier case, an individual arrives at a true belief through justified means but as a result of a false premise or extraneous coincidence. Intuitively, we would say that such an individual does not possess knowledge.**, **There is a principle that knowledge cannot be present if the justification leads accidentally to truth, implying that extra conditions beyond externalist criteria are necessary to avoid Gettier problems.**
