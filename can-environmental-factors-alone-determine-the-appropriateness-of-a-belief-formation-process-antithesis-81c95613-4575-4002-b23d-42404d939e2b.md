## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief through proper cognitive processes, but in an environment rife with false information, such as misinformation online. Intuitively, if the belief is true, we might judge that the person still knows it.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests knowledge attribution should focus more on the reliability and integrity of personal cognitive processes rather than the surrounding environment alone.**
