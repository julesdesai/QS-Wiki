## Content

**Suppose we have a case where the processes usually yield true beliefs on average, but an individual instance produces a false belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that knowledge does not arise in this instance, or that knowledge depends on general reliability rather than specific cases. If we say the knowledge depends on average reliability, it raises questions about specific instances.**
