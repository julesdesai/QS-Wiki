## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on a reliable process, the proposition is true, and yet their belief is true only due to luck. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be based on mere luck. This principle, together with the necessity for reliable belief production, suggests that reliability alone may not be sufficient for knowledge.**
