## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a true belief about a scientific theory based on dogmatic adherence rather than understanding. This belief might be non-accidentally true due to the support behind the theory, but intuitively it might not be counted as knowledge due to a lack of comprehension.**, **There is a plausible principle that understanding is a component of knowledge. This principle suggests that having a non-accidentally true belief is insufficient for knowledge without comprehension.**
