## Content

**Picture a case where Pat, a scientist, finds data indicating a hypothesis is true, but the data is later partially discredited. Despite the flawed data, the hypothesis is accurate. Intuitively, Pat's earlier justified belief might still count as knowledge, even if causal evidence was misleading.**, **Misleading evidence challenges the notion that a direct causal connection is always necessary for maintaining knowledge.**
