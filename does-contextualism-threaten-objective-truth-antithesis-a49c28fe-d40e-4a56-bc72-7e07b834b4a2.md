## Content

**A plausible principle is that knowledge is connected to objective truth about the world. If knowledge varies by context, just the context of inquiry can influence whether a proposition is known without changing its objective truth, challenging the link between knowledge and truth.**, **Consider a scenario where two individuals have opposite views of a fact in differing contexts. Intuitively, we would judge that if contextualism is correct, both could 'know' contradictory facts if their contexts allowed it, challenging the objective nature of truth.**, **It is implausible that a context-sensitive framework for knowledge maintains the same rigorous requirements for true propositions if such propositions can be known or unknown merely by changing context.**
