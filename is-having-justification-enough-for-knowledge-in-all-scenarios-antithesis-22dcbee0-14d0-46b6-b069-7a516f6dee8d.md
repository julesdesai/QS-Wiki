## Content

**There is a plausible principle that having justification only indicates a belief is supported by evidence but does not guarantee it reflects the truth outside the actual world, thus being insufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a student who has strong justification for a historical fact based on textbooks, all of which are misleading in nearby scenarios. Intuitively, this student lacks knowledge even with justification.**
