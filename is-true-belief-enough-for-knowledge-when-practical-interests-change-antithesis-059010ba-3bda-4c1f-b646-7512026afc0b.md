**A case in which some person believes it will rain because they see dark clouds, the clouds do indicate rain, and they prioritize staying dry can be seen as practical for them.**, **Consider another case where a farmer sees the same clouds and relies on rain for crops but is wrong about its timing, yet their practical interest in rain is greater.**, **It seems implausible to see both cases as equally knowledgeable if true belief based on practical interest is sufficient for knowing a proposition.**
