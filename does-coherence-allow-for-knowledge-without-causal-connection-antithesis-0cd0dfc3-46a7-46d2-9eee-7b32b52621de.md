**Parent:** [Knowledge as Coherentism](knowledge-as-coherentism-synthesis-d63bd1e5-75cf-404b-b00d-99a1f2772c05.md)

## Content

**It is plausible that knowing a proposition involves a causal connection between the knower and the fact known.**, **A set of coherent beliefs could be entirely fabricated with no causal interaction with the actual state of the world, challenging the idea that coherence alone suffices for knowledge.**
