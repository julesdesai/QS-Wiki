## Content

**Suppose a person uses a reliable thermometer to determine it is 72째F every day for a year and forms the belief it is 72째F today. Intuitively, this person does not know it is 72째F today just because they have been right in the past.**, **Suppose in a similar scenario the thermometer has always been accurate by coincidence. It is implausible that the person knows it is 72째F today without additional evidence.**
