## Content

**There is a plausible principle that excessive variability in standards of proof leads to skepticism.**, **Consider a context-sensitive justification where the standards become so flexible that, in any given context, one could always doubt whether sufficient justification is achieved. This variability might push us toward skepticism rather than confirming knowledge.**
