## Content

**Imagine a case where person A correctly identifies a rare bird species in their garden. Intuitively, A has knowledge of the species present despite the bird's rarity.**, **The principle that a reliable belief is one that could not easily be false implies person A should not have knowledge if the identification could easily be false.**, **In the rare bird case, it seems implausible to deny person A's knowledge when they have observed the species directly, despite its rarity, suggesting safety condition failures.**
