## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief that it will rain based solely on reading a false weather prediction, yet it does rain due to an unexpected storm. Intuitively, we would judge that the person's belief does not genuinely track the truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that for belief to track truth, there must be a causal connection or reliable method leading to the truth, which is absent in this case.**
