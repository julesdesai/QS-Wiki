## Content

**Suppose a case where person C knows a proposition based on contextually adequate standards, yet an error in belief undermines the authenticity of the knowledge claim. Intuitively, reliance on contextual standards seems unable to sufficiently preclude errors that affect the knowledge claim.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be sufficiently grounded if the potential for significant errors isn't adequately controlled by the context's standards.**
