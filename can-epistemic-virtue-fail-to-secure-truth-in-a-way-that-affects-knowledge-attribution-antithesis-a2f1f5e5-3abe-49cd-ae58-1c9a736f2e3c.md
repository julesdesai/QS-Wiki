## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person's belief results from a highly reliable method that is suddenly and unknowingly compromised, such as a usually reliable scientific instrument malfunctioning. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge due to the lack of actual reliability in this instance.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief arising from epistemic virtue should still be sensitive to truth and external factors. This principle together with the result from epistemic virtue entails that mere virtue-driven belief might not secure truth in every case.**, **It is implausible that relying solely on epistemic virtue, without considering the actual reliability of the belief-forming method, consistently delivers knowledge.**
