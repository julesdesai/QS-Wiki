## Content

**There is a plausible principle that human knowledge is fallible and limited by cognitive capacity. This principle together with the requirement of having no defeaters suggests that attaining knowledge is an unrealistic goal.**, **Imagine a person who accurately believes their partner is faithful, but there exists a true rumor the person is unaware of that their partner was unfaithful once. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows their partner to be faithful, undermining knowledge due to the potential defeater.**, **The No-Defeaters View implies individuals would need comprehensive awareness of all possible true defeaters, which exceeds typical human cognitive limitations.**
