## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person guesses the outcome of a coin flip and forms a belief that turns out to be true. Intuitively, we would not consider this belief to be knowledge.**, **A belief that turns out to be true by chance is not formed by a reliable cognitive process because the reliability of guesswork cannot be quantified or assured.**
