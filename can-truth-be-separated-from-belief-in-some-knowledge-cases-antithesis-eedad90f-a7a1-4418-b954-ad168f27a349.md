## Content

**Suppose a person, Bob, asserts a future proposition about a random event that turns out true, like "It will rain tomorrow," but with no reasonable basis. Bob's belief was a guess, not knowledge, which suggests belief must coincide with reasonable justification and truth.**, **It is implausible that mere coincidence of belief and truth satisfies the conditions of knowledge since more systematic basis is required.**
