## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's dynamic belief system adapts so radically and quickly that coherence is disrupted by constant change. Intuitively, this suggests instability, which undermines confidence in the systemâ€™s reliability.**, **It is implausible that a belief system in perpetual flux can provide the stability required for genuine knowledge.**
