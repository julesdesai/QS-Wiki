## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person makes a broad scientific generalization based on limited but consistent evidence; intuitively, we might say they have knowledge of the generalization despite minimal base level justification. If we say they have knowledge, then base level justification seems insufficient for preserving knowledge of generalizations.**, **It is implausible that we can dismiss generalizations as knowledge purely due to insufficient base level justification when they are part of scientific practice.**
