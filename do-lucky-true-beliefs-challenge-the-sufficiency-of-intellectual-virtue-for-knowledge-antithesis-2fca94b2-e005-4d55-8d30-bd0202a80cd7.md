## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through an intellectual virtue, yet the belief is true due to sheer luck, such as guessing the outcome of a fair coin toss. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, despite the belief resulting from an intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot arise from lucky true beliefs. This principle together with the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge leads to a contradiction, since luck can affect beliefs derived from intellectual virtue.**
