**A case can arise where a person believes a true proposition based on a reliable process, yet the truth of the belief is coincidental due to external factors not related to the process.**, **In scenarios where a reliable process is applied, extraneous chance factors can still lead to the truth, raising the question of whether this is genuinely non-luck knowledge.**
