## Content

**Consider a scenario in which multiple people use the same type of reliable cognitive process but only one person arrives at the true belief due to coincidence rather than the inherent reliability of the process.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the reliability of the process alone is not sufficient for knowledge since true belief arose from luck rather than the cognitive process itself.**
