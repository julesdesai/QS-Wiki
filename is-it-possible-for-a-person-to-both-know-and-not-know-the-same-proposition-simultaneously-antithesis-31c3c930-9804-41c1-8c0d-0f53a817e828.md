## Content

**Suppose we are in a scenario where two conversational contexts overlap, such as a garden party where some people are engaged in a relaxed discussion about astronomy and others in a rigorous scientific debate about the same topic. Intuitively, it seems that a person cannot both know and not know a fact about the solar system depending on which group hears their claim.**, **Knowledge as Contextualism allows that the same person could be said to know a proposition in one conversational context but not know it in another at the same time, which seems to imply a contradiction.**
