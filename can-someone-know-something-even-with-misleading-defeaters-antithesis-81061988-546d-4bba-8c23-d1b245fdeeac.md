## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone has a justified, true belief, but there are misleading defeaters that do not actually affect the truth or justification of the belief. Intuitively, it seems reasonable the person still possesses knowledge despite these misleading factors.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be based on actual defeaters, not misleading appearances. This principle together with the demand for no defeaters entails that misleading factors incorrectly remove knowledge.**
