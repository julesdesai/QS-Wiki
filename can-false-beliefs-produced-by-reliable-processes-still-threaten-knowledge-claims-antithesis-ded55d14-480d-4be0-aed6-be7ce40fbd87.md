## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a reliable cognitive process generates a true belief alongside several false beliefs under similar circumstances. Intuitively, we have to say that this damages the reliability of the process. If we say this damages the reliability, then true knowledge from this process is undermined.**, **There is a plausible principle that a cognitive process yielding both true and false beliefs in similar contexts is not fully reliable. This principle suggests that the mere fact of a belief being true is insufficient for knowledge if the process could equally yield false beliefs.**
