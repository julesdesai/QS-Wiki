**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with a dynamic system of beliefs that can adapt to new evidence**, **The degree of justification for a belief corresponds to its coherence across possible scenarios**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, the belief coheres with a dynamic system of beliefs that can adapt to new evidence, and it is justified across a certainty gradient**
