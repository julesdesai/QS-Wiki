## Content

**Consider scenarios in which personal traits such as charisma lead others to believe truths. Intuitively, these believers would not have knowledge in any epistemically robust sense.**, **There is a plausible principle that genuine knowledge cannot be based solely on traits unrelated to forming true beliefs. This principle together with non-epistemic traits occasionally leading to truth raises doubts about the necessity of specific virtues.**
