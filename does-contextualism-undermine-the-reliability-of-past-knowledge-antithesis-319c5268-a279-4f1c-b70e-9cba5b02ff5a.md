## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knew a historical fact in a relaxed context at one time. In a current skeptical context, similar knowledge claims are now unjustified. Intuitively, we might judge that such past knowledge is questionable.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge claims made reliably in the past should remain valid unless clear, relevant new evidence undermines them.**, **It is implausible that past knowledge can become retrospectively invalid due to mere changes in contemporary context.**
