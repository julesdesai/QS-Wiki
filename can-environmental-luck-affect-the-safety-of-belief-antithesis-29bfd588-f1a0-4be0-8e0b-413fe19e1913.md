## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Carla, forms a belief based on what she sees, but unbeknownst to her, the environment contains many similar deceptive elements. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that her belief is not safe.**, **It is plausible that if the truth of a belief is fragile due to deceptive environments, that belief is not safe in a way that affects knowledge.**
