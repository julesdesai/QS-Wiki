## Content

**Suppose we have a case involving expert intuition, where a skilled chess player makes a correct move based not on explicit reasoning but on an immediate, subconscious recognition of patterns. Intuitively, we believe the player possesses knowledge even if intellectual virtues, traditionally requiring reflective justification, are not involved.**, **It is implausible that needing intellectual virtues accounts for all forms of knowledge, particularly those involving expert intuition or creativity.**
