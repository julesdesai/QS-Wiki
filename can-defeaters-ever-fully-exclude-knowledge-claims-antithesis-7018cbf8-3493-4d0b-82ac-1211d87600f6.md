## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a defeater must have sufficient relevance to exclude a valid knowledge claim. This principle implies that not all defeaters result in the absence of knowledge.**, **Consider a person with justified true belief and minor, irrelevant defeaters. Intuitively, these defeaters seem insufficient to completely exclude their claim to knowledge.**
