**Consider a scenario where a person believes correctly that there will be a traffic-free road because they look at fake traffic data that coincidentally corresponds to real traffic conditions. The proposition is true, there are no defeaters, yet intuitively, such a person does not know the road is traffic-free since their belief seems true by chance.**
