## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person accurately guesses the outcome of a coin flip, believing it will land heads, it does land heads, and in most nearby possible worlds, the coin would land tails. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the coin will land heads, despite the belief being true.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be stable across similar situations, and this principle entails that mere accuracy without stability does not constitute knowledge.**
