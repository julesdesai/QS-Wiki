## Content

**Suppose someone flips a coin and randomly guesses it will land on heads. Without any further evidence, the guess is justified by the idea that a coin toss is equally likely to land heads or tails. The coin does indeed land on heads.**, **Intuitively, the person does not 'know' the outcome was heads, only guessed fortunately, despite the belief being true and having superficial justification.**
