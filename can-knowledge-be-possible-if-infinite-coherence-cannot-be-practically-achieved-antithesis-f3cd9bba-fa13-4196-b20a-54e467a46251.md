## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person tries to justify their belief by an infinite chain of reasoning, but never finishes the chain. Intuitively, we would say that they have not achieved knowledge.**, **The requirement for a belief to cohere with an infinite chain of justifications implies that complete validation cannot be practically realized by a finite mind.**, **Achieving coherence with an infinite chain seems to demand an idealized reasoning process beyond human capacity, calling into question the attainability of knowledge itself.**
