## Content

**Imagine two scientists working in isolated fields, each with coherent but mutually contradictory theories. Intuitively, it seems incorrect to say both have knowledge of their respective theories if they contradict each other.**, **The plausible principle that contradictory beliefs cannot both be knowledge suggests that coherence may not be a sufficient condition for knowledge.**
