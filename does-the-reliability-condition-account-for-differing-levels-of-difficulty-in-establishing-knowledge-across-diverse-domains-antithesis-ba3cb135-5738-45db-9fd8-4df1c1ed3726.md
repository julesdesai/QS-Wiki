## Content

**Consider a scenario where knowledge of a simple arithmetic fact and knowledge of a complex scientific theory are both claimed to result from reliable processes. Intuitively, the nature and difficulty of verifying these differ significantly.**, **The uneven difficulty in achieving reliable beliefs across different domains suggests that the notion of reliability might not fully encapsulate what it means to know something.**
