## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a given body of evidence underdetermines which belief to hold as knowledge if multiple beliefs are equally supported.**, **Consider a scenario where probabilistic reasoning allows for several equally probable outcomes, yet only one can be true. Intuitively, it suggests a limitation in identifying knowledge through probabilistic reasoning alone.**
