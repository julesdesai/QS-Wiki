## Content

**Suppose a person Jane believes that her friend is honest because an honest friend told her so. Intuitively, we either have to say that Jane knows her friend is honest because she has justification through another honest friend, or that she does not know because the justification is circular. If we say she knows, then circular reasoning provides true knowledge. If we say she does not know, then justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.**
