## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alex, believes a proposition that they see someone in their office, which is true because someone is in the office but not the person Alex thought due to visual error. Intuitively, we would judge that Alex does not have knowledge of this fact.**, **The situation demonstrates that belief, truth, and non-fallacious justification alone are insufficient for knowledge, as shown by the absence of knowledge in this case despite satisfying these conditions.**
