**Imagine a journalist who investigates an anonymous tip that turns out to be true. The truth of the tip is revealed by pure chance, as the source mistakenly conveyed the correct information. Although the belief's truth persists even in nearby possible situations, the truth appears arrived at by luck. It is implausible to classify this as knowledge since the correctness of the belief is coincidental.**
