## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person reads a clock that is stuck at the correct time, leading them to believe the correct current time. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the time despite the belief-truth conjunction and truth-tracking appearance.**, **It is implausible that beliefs which coincide with truth purely by accident or due to malfunction should qualify as knowledge.**, **This implies a belief might meet the truth-tracking criterion incidentally without constituting knowledge.**
