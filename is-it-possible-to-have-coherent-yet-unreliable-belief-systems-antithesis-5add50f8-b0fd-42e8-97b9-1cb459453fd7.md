## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a personâ€™s belief system is entirely internally consistent but formed based on an unreliable cognitive process. Intuitively, we either have to say that beliefs formed in this way count as knowledge or they do not. If we say they count as knowledge, it seems that the reliability of the belief formation process is irrelevant, which is implausible. If we say they do not count as knowledge, then coherence alone is not sufficient for knowledge.**
