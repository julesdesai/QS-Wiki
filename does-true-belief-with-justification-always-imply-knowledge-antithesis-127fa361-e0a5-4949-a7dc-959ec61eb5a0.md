**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the person has strong, but misleading, evidence supporting that belief.**, **In such a case, intuitively, we might hesitate to say that the person truly knows the proposition, as their justification is derived from misleading evidence.**
