## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone accepts a true proposition accidentally, with practical benefits, without a sound basis. They may win a game by guessing, but intuitively, we contest calling this knowledge.**, **The integration of truth, acceptance, and usefulness implies that omission of sound reasoning or justification leaves a knowledge claim deficient. Truth or usefulness alone may be insufficient without justified acceptance.**
