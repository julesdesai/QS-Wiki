## Content

**Imagine two individuals with identical evidence for a proposition, yet in different cultural contexts with different standards for knowledge. It seems implausible that one knows and the other does not, despite the identical evidence.**, **Suppose we say knowledge is context-dependent in such a case. Intuitively, this leads to the implausible conclusion that equally justified beliefs can result in different knowledge statuses solely based on differing contextual standards.**
