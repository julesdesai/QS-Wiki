## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person updates their belief system continually, achieving coherence each time but adopting false beliefs along the way. Intuitively, we would judge that such shifting coherence doesn't ensure consistent truth adherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that consistent adherence to truth should anchor knowledge, and coherence alone might not secure this when beliefs change.**
