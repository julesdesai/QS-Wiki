## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person's intellectual virtue is compromised by some malfunction, like a cognitive bias or disorder. Intuitively, in such a case, a resulting true belief does not seem to constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, it should be free from malfunctions in virtue. This principle, combined with cases where malfunctions lead to true beliefs, challenges whether such instances amount to knowledge.**
