## Content

**Consider a scenario where what counts as justification drastically changes between academic, legal, and everyday contexts. Intuitively, this variability makes "justified" too vague to reliably underlie knowledge.**, **Suppose limitations of context allow weak evidence to constitute justification. Intuitively, weak justification should not lead to knowledge.**
