## Content

**There are cases in which people possess knowledge intuitively or through expertise, where the justification for their belief is not explicitly articulable or accessible to their consciousness. Intuitively, we would judge that these people still possess knowledge.**, **A plausible principle states that knowledge can be implicit or tacit, challenging the notion that all knowledge must have justification that is consciously accessible.**, **It is implausible that the requirement of conscious access to justification covers all instances of knowledge, especially in cases involving complex or automatic cognitive processes like expertise.**
