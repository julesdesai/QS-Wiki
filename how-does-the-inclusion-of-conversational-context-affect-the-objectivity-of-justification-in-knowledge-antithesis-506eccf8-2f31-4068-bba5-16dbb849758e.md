## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if justification is relative to conversational context, then justification can become subjective.**, **Suppose we have a scenario where two different groups are discussing the same proposition, and each group has different conversational contexts. Intuitively, if justification is relative to each group's context, it appears that the same belief can be justified for one group but not the other.**, **It is implausible that the same proposition should simultaneously be both justified and unjustified merely due to differences in conversational context.**
