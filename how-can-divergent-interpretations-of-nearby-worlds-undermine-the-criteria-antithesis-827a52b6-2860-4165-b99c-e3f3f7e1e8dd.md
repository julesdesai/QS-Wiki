## Content

**Consider a scenario where interpretations of "nearby possible worlds" are significantly divergent, leading to different judgments about whether a belief tracks truth. In such scenarios, intuitively, we would judge that varying interpretations question the coherence or applicability of the truth-tracking condition.**, **It is implausible that relying on vague or context-dependent criteria could lead to consistent judgments about what constitutes knowledge.**, **This implies a potential for inconsistent application of the truth-tracking criteria across cases due to variability in the concept of "nearby worlds."**
