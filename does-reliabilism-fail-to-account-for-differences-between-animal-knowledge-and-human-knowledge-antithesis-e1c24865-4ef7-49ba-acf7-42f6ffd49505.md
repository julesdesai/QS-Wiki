## Content

**There is a plausible principle that human knowledge requires more than just a reliable process; it requires rational deliberation and reflection.**, **Consider a scenario in which an animal forms true beliefs about its environment through reliable processes. Intuitively, we would say the animal "knows" in a different sense than a human who forms beliefs through deliberative reasoning even when both are reliably true.**
