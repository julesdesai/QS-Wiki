## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person looks at a stopped clock that fortunately shows the correct time, forming a true belief that it is 3 PM. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know it is 3 PM despite the true belief coming from a reliable process.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief may be true and produced by a generally reliable process but still be correct only due to luck, and such a belief does not constitute knowledge.**
