## Content

**There can exist multiple, equally coherent systems of belief that are mutually exclusive.**, **For example, philosophers in a fictional world might hold coherent belief systems based on differing foundational assumptions, yet not all can be true.**, **If coherence alone is sufficient for knowledge, then these conflicting systems would all qualify as knowledge, leading to a contradiction since they can't all be true simultaneously.**
