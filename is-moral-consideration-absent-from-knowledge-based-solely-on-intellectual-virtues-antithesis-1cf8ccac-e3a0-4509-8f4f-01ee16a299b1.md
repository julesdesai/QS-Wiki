## Content

**Consider a case where a person knows a fact through an intellectual virtue but uses this information in a morally wrong way, such as forming a belief to harm others. Intuitively, we might be reluctant to say this counts as true knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that actions grounded in intellectual virtue should align with some moral consideration, which is not addressed when focusing purely on intellectual virtues.**
