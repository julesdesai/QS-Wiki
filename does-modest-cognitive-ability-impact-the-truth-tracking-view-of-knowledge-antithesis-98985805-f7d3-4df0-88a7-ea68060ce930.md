## Content

**Consider a case where a person's limited cognitive abilities prevent them from considering alternative scenarios, yet they hold a true belief that tracks the truth. Intuitively, we would still regard them as having knowledge, despite their inability to effectively track alternate possibilities.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth-tracking should not disadvantage those with cognitive limitations who yet meet truth and belief conditions for knowledge.**
