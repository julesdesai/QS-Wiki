## Content

**Suppose a person holds a true belief that is safe in the actual world, but in several slightly different nearby possible worlds, the belief would be false due to minor details. Intuitively, this person does not have knowledge because the belief's truth seems too easily lost.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires stability across not just the actual world but also nearby possible worlds.**
