## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual operates with mechanical skill or habit, such as typing or playing an instrument, forming true beliefs about their actions without any conscious intellectual deliberation. Intuitively, we would judge that they know what they are doing.**, **It is implausible that the requirement of intellectual virtue consistently applies to all areas of knowledge, as practical knowledge often relies on skill or habit rather than intellectual virtues.**
