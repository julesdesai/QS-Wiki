## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition, and this belief is based on a justification considered foundational in one context but not in another. Intuitively, this raises doubt about whether such a justification can secure the truth of the proposition in every context.**, **It is implausible that a justification can both vary contextually and still guarantee the truth condition necessary for knowledge.**
