# Can Nozick's Tracking Theory handle cases of epistemic luck where the belief aligns with the truth?

**Node Type:** antithesis

**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Nozickâ€™s Tracking Theory](knowledge-as-nozicks-tracking-theory-synthesis-7493f9f6-30d1-4288-be5f-af28c330e668.md)

## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief based on incomplete evidence, and, through luck, the belief turns out to be true and would have been false had they continued gathering evidence. Intuitively, they do not have knowledge.**, **Tracking conditions could be satisfied through epistemic luck, which implies Tracking Theory might grant knowledge when intuitively it should not.**
