## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a proposition but there is a far-fetched hypothetical alternative such as being deceived by an evil demon. Intuitively, we might still say the person knows the proposition despite not ruling out this alternative.**, **There is a plausible principle that relevant alternatives must be reasonably likely or plausible, which challenges how we determine relevance against far-fetched scenarios.**
