## Content

**Suppose two individuals, each in different contexts, disagree on whether a proposition is known. Intuitively, we either have to say both are correct due to their contexts or only one is correct. If we say both are correct, then we risk relativism where knowledge loses its objective grip. If we say only one is correct, contextualism does not explain the disagreement satisfactorily.**
