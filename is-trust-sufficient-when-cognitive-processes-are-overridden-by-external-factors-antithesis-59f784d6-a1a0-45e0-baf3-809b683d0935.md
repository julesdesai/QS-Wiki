## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's cognitive processes are overridden or bypassed by persuasive yet unreliable source despite their better judgement, leading to a true belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that this results in knowledge or it does not. If we say it results in knowledge, this implies that overriding cognitive processing is irrelevant. If we say it does not result in knowledge, then source's appeal is insufficient.**, **Knowledge is often associated not only with belief and truth but also with unobstructed cognitive processing, which mere reliance on source appeal might bypass.**
