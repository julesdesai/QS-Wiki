**It is implausible that empirical propositions, which are based on sensory experience, can ever be justified infallibly. Since our senses can be mistaken, they might never provide the absolute certainty required for infallible justification.**, **Consider the proposition that "there are trees outside the window," which is typically known through looking outside. Given the possibility of visual illusions or hallucinations, infallible justification seems unattainable for such a claim.**
