## Content

**Consider a case where someone forms a belief through a reliable process unconsciously and comes to have an intuitive grasp of its reliability without explicit awareness of any such understanding. Intuitively, one might feel hesitant to claim loss of knowledge due to the lack of consciousness.**, **There is a plausible principle that implicit understanding, even if unrecognized at the conscious level, can satisfy the conditions of having understanding for knowledge.**
