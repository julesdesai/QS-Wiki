**Parent:** [Knowledge with a No-Defeaters Clause](knowledge-with-a-no-defeaters-clause-synthesis-0701b395-900b-40e2-bb7e-a5beb8a1677b.md)

## Content

**Consider a case where a person learns a scientific fact, such as a chemical property, from a reputable source. Intuitively, they seem to possess knowledge of this fact.**, **Suppose that, unknown to them, recent undisclosed studies have disproven the fact, serving as a defeater. Intuitively, we might think they do not know, as the newer information would potentially undermine their belief if known.**, **The no-defeaters clause implies they know, assuming no explicit contradiction in their immediate understanding, which can conflict with the intuition that background undisclosed updates matter for knowledge.**
