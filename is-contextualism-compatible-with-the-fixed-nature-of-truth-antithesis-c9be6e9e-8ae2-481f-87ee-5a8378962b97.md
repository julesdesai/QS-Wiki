## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the truth of a proposition is fixed and does not vary across contexts.**, **Contextualism suggests the necessary conditions for knowledge can vary, introducing the idea that what one can know changes with context.**, **This variability in knowledge conditions appears to conflict with the static nature of the truth of propositions, leading to a tension between truth and knowledge under contextualism.**
