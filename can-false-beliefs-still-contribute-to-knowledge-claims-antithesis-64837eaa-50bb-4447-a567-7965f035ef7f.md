## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a false proposition that leads them to arrive at a true belief about another proposition. Intuitively, we either have to say that the false belief invalidates their claim to knowledge or that the true belief still counts as knowledge. If we say the false belief invalidates their claim to knowledge, then knowledge cannot tolerate any false beliefs in the cognitive process. If we say the true belief still counts as knowledge, then some false beliefs can coexist with knowledge claims.**, **A person arrives at a true belief through a process involving a false belief, such as believing incorrectly that a broken clock shows the correct time when it incidentally does.**
