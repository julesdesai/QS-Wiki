## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition because of strong but misleading evidence. If the proposition were false, they would still hold their belief due to the evidence they have. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it must be the case that if the proposition were false, they would not believe it. If a person would believe a proposition even if it were false, their belief is not sensitive to its truth.**
