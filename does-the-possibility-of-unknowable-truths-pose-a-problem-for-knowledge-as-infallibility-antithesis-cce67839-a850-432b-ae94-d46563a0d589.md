## Content

**Suppose there is a proposition about the distant future that is currently true but unknowable by anyone, such as a specific event happening in a million years.**, **If knowledge requires no possibility of error, then no one can know this proposition now, even though it is true.**, **Intuitively, there are true propositions that we cannot presently know, challenging the sufficiency condition for knowledge.**
