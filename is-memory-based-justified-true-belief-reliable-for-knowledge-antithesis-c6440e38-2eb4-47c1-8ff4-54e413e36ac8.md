## Content

**A person recalls seeing a sign on a door that claims the meeting is at 3 PM and forms a justified true belief about the meeting time based on this memory**, **However, suppose the sign was changed while this person attended a prior meeting and now shows a different time, but their justified belief happens to be true for unrelated reasons**, **The justified true belief based on outdated memory suggests the insufficiency for knowledge when the justification is no longer current or accurate**
