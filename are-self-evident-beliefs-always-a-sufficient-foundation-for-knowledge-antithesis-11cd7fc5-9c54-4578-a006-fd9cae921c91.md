## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone forms a belief based solely on a self-evident proposition, but later discovers the method was unreliable. Intuitively, we would judge the belief not to be knowledge because the method wasn't robust, even though the belief was self-evident.**, **There is a plausible principle that self-evident beliefs justify only when derived within a reliable method. This principle together with the scenario entails that self-evident beliefs alone are insufficient for knowledge.**
