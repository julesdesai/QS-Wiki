## Content

**Consider the case in which a person named Sarah predicts it will rain by randomly picking a day and is right because of unusual weather patterns. Although the belief is true, it derived accidentally through irrelevant justifications. Intuitively, Sarah does not have knowledge.**, **In a scenario where an assumption about the world based on random guessing happens to be true, such as guessing the number of candies in a jar people havenâ€™t seen, the person forming the belief lacks knowledge despite having a true belief.**
