## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence provided by another, without using their own intellectual virtues. Intuitively, we would have to say that this person could know the proposition even though they did not exercise their own intellectual virtue in forming the belief. If we say they do not know, this undermines the reliability of testimony. If we say they do know, this challenges the necessity condition of exercising intellectual virtue.**
