## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge consists of justified true belief, which traditionally requires universally applicable criteria for justification.**, **If justification is relative to conversational context, then the criteria for obtaining knowledge can vary, which contrasts with the traditional, context-independent approach.**, **Consider a case where a person has a belief justified in one context but not another; intuitively, this disrupts the traditional understanding of justified true belief.**
