## Content

**Suppose a person has two foundational beliefs, one based on a trusted authority that is mistaken and one based on reliable direct observation that is correct. These beliefs lead to conflicting conclusions. Intuitively, it is unclear which belief should take priority for coherence.**, **This scenario implies that the existence of conflicting foundational beliefs challenges the sufficiency of the belief, truth, and coherence conditions for knowledge.**
