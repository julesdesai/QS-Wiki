## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition because they accidentally overheard it from a reliable source. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than accidentally acquiring true beliefs even if those beliefs track the truth. This principle together with the scenario above entails that truth-tracking alone is not always sufficient for knowledge.**
