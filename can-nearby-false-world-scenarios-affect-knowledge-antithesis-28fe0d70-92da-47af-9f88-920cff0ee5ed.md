## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person holds a true belief in the actual world, but in nearby worlds, very minor changes make the belief false, indicating fragility in the safety of this knowledge. Intuitively, the knowledge claim seems weak if slightly altered circumstances lead to error.**, **In scenarios like navigating a maze with one correct path that only coincidentally aligns in the actual world, nearby worlds showcasing diverging paths raise questions about this being knowledge.**
