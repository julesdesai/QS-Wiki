## Content

**There is a plausible principle that some cognitive competencies do not qualify as intellectual virtues. This principle raises the question of whether knowledge relies uniformly on all competencies.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person excels in memorization, a cognitive competence, but it doesnâ€™t represent a broader intellectual virtue. Intuitively, knowledge based merely on such competencies seems questionable.**
