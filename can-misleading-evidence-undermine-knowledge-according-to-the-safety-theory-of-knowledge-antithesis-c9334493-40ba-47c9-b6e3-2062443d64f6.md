## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on what turns out to be misleading evidence, and in most nearby possible worlds, the person's belief is still true. Intuitively, we have to say that the person does not have knowledge due to the misleading nature of the evidence.**, **A plausible principle is that evidence should support the proposition believed for the belief to amount to knowledge. When a belief is true in nearby worlds but not supported by evidence, this suggests a lack of knowledge.**
