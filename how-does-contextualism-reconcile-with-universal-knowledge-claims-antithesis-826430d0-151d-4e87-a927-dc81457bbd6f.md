## Content

**People often make universal knowledge claims, such as scientific facts, that are expected to hold across diverse contexts. Intuitively, if contexts dictate knowledge, then these universal claims should vary, which is counterintuitive to the universal acceptance of facts.**, **If contextual factors mean knowledge varies, universal claims lose their binding power, questioning their place in a contextualism framework.**
