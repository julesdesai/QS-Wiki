**Suppose a person believes that a particular person will attend a meeting and this belief is based on hearing an announcement from an unreliable spokesperson**, **In this scenario, the person attends the meeting and the initial belief is true, but the justification, being based on unreliable information, seems insufficient for knowledge**, **The existence of true belief with fallible justification challenges the sufficiency of justified true belief for knowledge when the justification comes from unreliable sources**
