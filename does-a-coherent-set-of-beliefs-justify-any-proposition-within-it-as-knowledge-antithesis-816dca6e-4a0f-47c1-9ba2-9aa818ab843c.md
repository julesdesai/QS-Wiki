## Content

**Consider a coherent system of beliefs that includes a belief in astrology based on well-integrated stories. In such a system, intuitively, the belief in astrology lacks genuine justification because it fails common external tests of falsity.**, **It is implausible that a belief system that is coherent internally but clashes with external evidence yields any of its propositions as knowledge.**
