## Content

**A plausible principle is that knowledge is closed under known logical entailment, meaning that if you know one thing and know it entails another, you should know that other thing too.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person knows a proposition and knows it entails a second proposition, yet their belief in the second proposition would not be sensitive if the first were false. Intuitively, they should know both propositions, despite the sensitivity condition breaking.**
