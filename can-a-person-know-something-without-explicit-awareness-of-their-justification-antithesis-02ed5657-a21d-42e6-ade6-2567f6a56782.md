## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence, but they are not explicitly aware of the source of justification. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might still judge that the person knows the proposition.**, **Awareness of justification may not always be necessary for knowledge if the processes underlying the justification are reliable and generally trustworthy.**
