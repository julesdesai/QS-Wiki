## Content

**Suppose someone believes a complicated mathematical theorem to be true because of a vague feeling, without understanding the proof or reasoning behind it.**, **The theorem they believe in is actually true, and their feeling results from an unreliable method rather than intellectual virtue or competence.**, **Intuitively, despite the belief being true, it seems that the person does not have knowledge of the theorem due to the lack of intellectual competence in forming the belief.**
