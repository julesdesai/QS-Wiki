## Content

**Imagine a situation where someone has a coherent system of beliefs based on false assumptions, yet by coincidence, one belief happens to be true. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows that particular proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be a matter of mere luck or coincidence. This principle together with the possibility of true beliefs arising by chance in a coherent system entails that coherentist justification alone is vulnerable to Gettier-style cases.**
