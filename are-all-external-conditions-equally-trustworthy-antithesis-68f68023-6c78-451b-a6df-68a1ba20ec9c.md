## Content

**Consider a scenario where a personâ€™s belief is based on an external condition from an unreliable source that has happened to be correct in the past by chance. Intuitively, this belief does not seem to be knowledge.**, **This highlights the implausibility that all forms of external conditions can equally justify belief, pressing for a distinction between reliable and unreliable external justifications.**
