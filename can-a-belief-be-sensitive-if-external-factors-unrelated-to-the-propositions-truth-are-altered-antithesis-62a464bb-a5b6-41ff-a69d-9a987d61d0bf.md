**Suppose a person looks at a clock that is known to malfunction but happens to show the correct time. The person believes it is 3 PM based on looking at the clock, and indeed it is 3 PM.**, **If it were not 3 PM, the clock might still have shown 3 PM due to its malfunctioning nature, so the sensitivity condition fails.**
