## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on a lucky guess. Intuitively, we would say that this person does not have knowledge even though the belief is true and could not easily have been false due to the circumstances allowing the lucky guess.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must be well-grounded or reliably formed. This principle suggests that true belief alone, even if the belief could not easily have been false, is not sufficient for knowledge.**
