## Content

**A person forms a belief based on a reliable cognitive process like a well-functioning perception, yet the belief is true only due to an accident or luck, such as seeing a very convincing but fake scenario that coincidentally corresponds to reality elsewhere.**, **Intuitively, if a belief is true only by chance, then it does not constitute knowledge even if formed by a reliable process.**
