## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person correctly believes they will win the lottery because they have an expert informant who rarely errs. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know they will win the lottery.**, **There is a plausible principle that to know a proposition, one must discriminate that the claimed proposition is true in various close scenarios where it is false. This principle, together with the claim that the person cannot discriminate their winning ticket from another ticket in such close scenarios, suggests they do not know they will win.**
