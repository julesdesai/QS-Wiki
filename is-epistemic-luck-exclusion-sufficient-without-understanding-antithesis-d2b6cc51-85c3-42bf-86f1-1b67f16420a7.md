## Content

**Suppose a person, David, has a true belief about a scientific law purely by memorization without comprehension. Intuitively, David lacks knowledge despite avoiding epistemic luck in forming the belief.**, **It is implausible to claim that mere epistemic luck exclusion suffices for knowledge if understanding of the proposition is absent. This implies understanding might be an additional requirement for knowledge.**
