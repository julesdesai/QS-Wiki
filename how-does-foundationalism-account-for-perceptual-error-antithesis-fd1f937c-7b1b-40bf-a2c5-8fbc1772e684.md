## Content

**Consider a scenario where foundational perceptual beliefs are subject to optical illusions or sensory errors. Intuitively, these errors challenge the claim that perceptual beliefs can be irreversibly foundational.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable justification must accommodate perceptual errors. This principle together with the foundationalist reliance on perceptual beliefs reveals potential vulnerabilities.**
