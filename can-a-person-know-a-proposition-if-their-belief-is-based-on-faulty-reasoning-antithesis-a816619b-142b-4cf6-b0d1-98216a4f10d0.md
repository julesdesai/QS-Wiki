## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, but their belief arises from poor reasoning skills, such as fallacious logic. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or not. If we say the person knows the proposition, it conflicts with the idea that epistemic virtues, which include sound reasoning, are necessary for knowledge.**
