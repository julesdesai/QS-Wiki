## Content

**Consider a proposition that requires an infinite chain of causally linked justifications. Given human cognitive limitations, it is implausible that individuals can process or store such complex justification wholly.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a simple belief based on intuition or immediate perception, like "the sky is blue." Requiring infinite justification for such beliefs clashes with the simplicity and immediacy with which they are justified in practice.**
