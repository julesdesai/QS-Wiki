## Content

**Imagine a person in an isolated community with a coherent belief system about the world based on myths. Intuitively, we would judge that their beliefs do not constitute knowledge, as they do not connect with the reality external to their community.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must correspond with some form of external reality, not just cohere internally. This principle implies that mere coherence within an isolated system may not be sufficient for knowledge.**
