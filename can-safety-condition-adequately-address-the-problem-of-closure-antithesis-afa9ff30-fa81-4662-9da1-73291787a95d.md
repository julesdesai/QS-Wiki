## Content

**Imagine a person knows a proposition via a safe method and competently deduces another from it; however, in nearby possible scenarios, this deduction might be unsafe due to slight logical missteps they would typically make. Intuitively, knowledge should transfer safely in such deductive reasoning.**, **The safety condition cannot guarantee the preservation of knowledge across logical inferences, as it sometimes fails to account for subtleties in how beliefs are derived.**
