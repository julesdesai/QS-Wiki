## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence and that belief turns out to be true by luck rather than the evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not truly have knowledge in this scenario.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief be supported by non-luck conditions that are not satisfied in typical Gettier cases.**
