## Content

**Consider a situation where person R forms a true belief based on a data set and an incorrect irrelevant detail the person did not consider in forming the conclusion. Intuitively, R would be seen to know the conclusion since the error was irrelevant, contradicting the necessity of no falsehoods in R's evidence.**, **This possibility implies that someone might have knowledge despite having falsehoods present in some neglected part of their evidence, challenging the purposed no falsehood requirement.**
