## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition due to misleading evidence, such that the belief is true by coincidence. Intuitively, we would judge that this is not a case of knowledge.**, **Suppose the belief is such that in nearby possible worlds, if the person believes the proposition, it is not false. This safety condition would seem to be satisfied, yet the belief does not seem to be knowledge.**
