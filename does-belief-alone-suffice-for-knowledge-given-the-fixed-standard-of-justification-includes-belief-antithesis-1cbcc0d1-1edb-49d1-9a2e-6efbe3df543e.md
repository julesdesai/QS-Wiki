## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone forms a belief randomly about the outcome of a coin toss and it happens to be correct. Intuitively, we judge that this belief does not amount to knowledge despite being true because it lacks proper grounding.**, **There is a plausible principle that belief alone, even when appended by a fixed standard of justification, is insufficient for knowledge without proper grounding.**
