## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a personâ€™s belief is true due to an abnormal or unusual causal path that typically does not produce true beliefs. Intuitively, such a belief fails to qualify as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires non-deviant causal chains. This principle suggests that deviant causal paths are insufficient for knowledge claims.**
