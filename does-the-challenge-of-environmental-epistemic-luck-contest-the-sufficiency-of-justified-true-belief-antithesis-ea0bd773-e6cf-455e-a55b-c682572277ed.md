**Consider a scenario in which a hiker navigates using a reliable map and believes they are going in the right direction. Unknown to them, the environment has changed, rendering the map inaccurate. Coincidentally, the hiker reaches their destination because of unrelated factors, suggesting they had justified true belief without knowledge due to environmental epistemic luck.**
