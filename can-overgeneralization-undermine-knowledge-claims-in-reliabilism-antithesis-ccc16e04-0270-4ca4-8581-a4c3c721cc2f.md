## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a belief-forming process must not only be reliable but also appropriately specific and sensitive to the context to generate knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which someone uses a generally reliable belief-forming process, like visual perception, in inappropriate conditions, like heavy fog. Intuitively, we have to say that the beliefs formed in these conditions do not constitute knowledge even if the process is generally reliable.**
