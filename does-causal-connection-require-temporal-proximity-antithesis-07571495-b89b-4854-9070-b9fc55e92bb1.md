## Content

**Consider a situation where person P forms a belief about a past event based on a reliable historical process, but there is a significant temporal gap between the event and P's belief formation. Intuitively, large temporal gaps challenge the causal connection needed for knowledge.**, **The requirement for a causal connection between belief and proposition may be problematized by temporal distance.**
