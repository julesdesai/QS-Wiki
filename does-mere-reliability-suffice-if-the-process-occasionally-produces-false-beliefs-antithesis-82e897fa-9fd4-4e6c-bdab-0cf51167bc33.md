## Content

**A reliable process is one that generally leads to true beliefs.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person has a reliable cognitive process that usually gets things right except for a significant exception where it produces consistently false beliefs.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, we might judge that knowledge is undermined because reliability has exceptions that lead to falsehoods.**
