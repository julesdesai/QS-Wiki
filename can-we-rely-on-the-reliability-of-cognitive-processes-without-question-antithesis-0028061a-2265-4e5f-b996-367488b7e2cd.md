## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person uses a reliable cognitive process in most environments but not in an unusual environment. Intuitively, we would judge that the reliability of the process in unusual environments is questionable.**, **Suppose we have a belief formed in an unusual environment through a process that's generally reliable. Intuitively, we either have to say that this counts as knowledge or it doesn't. If we say it counts as knowledge, then we accept unreliable processes. If we say it doesn't count as knowledge, then reliability must account for environmental factors.**
