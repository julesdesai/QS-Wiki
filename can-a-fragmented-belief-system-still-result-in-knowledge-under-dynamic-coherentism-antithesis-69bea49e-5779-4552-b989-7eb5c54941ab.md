## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's beliefs are fragmented into multiple sub-systems, each dynamically coherent on its own, but not altogether. Intuitively, we question whether knowledge is achieved without an overarching coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that true coherence requires integration across a belief system, suggesting fragmentation poses a challenge to proper knowledge.**
