## Content

**Suppose we confront a person with deep-seated beliefs acquired since childhood, such as beliefs about moral norms, without clear awareness of their foundational status. Intuitively, one might see these as foundational due to their embeddedness, yet struggle to concretely identify or articulate them within context.**, **A plausible issue arises where identifying foundational beliefs is as tricky as the belief ascription process itself, complicating simplistic views about contextual foundations. This difficulty challenges straightforward sufficiency claims of foundational beliefs.**
