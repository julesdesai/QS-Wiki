## Content

**Imagine a traveler accurately believes they are in Paris because of several justified indicators: signs in French, the Eiffel Tower, people speaking French. If told that an unknown city mimicked these features perfectly, the traveler's confidence wanes and is unsure if they 'know' they're in Paris.**, **Intuitively, a true, justified belief seems insufficient due to this contextual sensitivity, suggesting that environmental factors influence knowledge claims.**
