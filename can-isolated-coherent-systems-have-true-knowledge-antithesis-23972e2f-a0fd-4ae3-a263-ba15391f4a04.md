## Content

**Imagine two people living in completely isolated worlds with coherent belief systems about their worlds. Intuitively, we would judge that it is possible both systems could be coherent but not necessarily true.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence within an isolated system does not ensure the truth of any beliefs held within that system. This principle suggests that merely having a coherent belief system doesn't ensure knowledge.**
