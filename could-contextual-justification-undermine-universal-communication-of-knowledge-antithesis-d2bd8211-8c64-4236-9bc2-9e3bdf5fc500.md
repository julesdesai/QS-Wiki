## Content

**Consider a scientist who asserts knowledge of a scientific principle in an academic context with rigorous standards but fails to communicate the same principle effectively to the public due to a change in context. The public context poses lower standards of justification, leading to potential misunderstanding.**, **It is plausible that universal communication of knowledge requires stable justification standards across different contexts. The reliance on contextually determined justification standards may hinder effective communication and understanding of knowledge universally.**
