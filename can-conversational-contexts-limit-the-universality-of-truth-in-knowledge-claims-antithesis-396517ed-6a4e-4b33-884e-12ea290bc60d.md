## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's belief is justified in one context but the truth condition of the belief is not met in another context. Intuitively, this suggests that truth itself might be relative to context.**, **It is implausible for truth, a traditionally universal condition, to vary based on conversational context.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth should remain constant regardless of the context in which a proposition is assessed.**
