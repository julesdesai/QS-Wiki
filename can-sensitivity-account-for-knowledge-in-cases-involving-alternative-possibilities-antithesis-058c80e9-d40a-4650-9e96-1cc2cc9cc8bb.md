## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is in a room full of identical fake and real clocks. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the time if they simply happen to look at a working clock**, **Suppose that the same person would not believe it is noon if the clock showed a different time. This would not suffice for knowing it is noon because the presence of many identical but non-working clocks undermines the reliability of this belief**
