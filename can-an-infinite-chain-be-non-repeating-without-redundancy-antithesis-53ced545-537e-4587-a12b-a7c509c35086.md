## Content

**In an infinite chain, whether non-repeating or not, there exists potential for redundancy across numerous justification steps.**, **Non-redundancy implies that each justification link must offer new, unique support continuously, challenging the practicality of maintaining novelty infinitely.**, **The challenge in ensuring true non-repetition suggests potential deficiencies in applying such a chain to real-world knowledge.**
