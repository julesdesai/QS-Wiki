## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Maria, correctly predicts a roulette outcome despite using a faulty method based on superstition and luck. Intuitively, we would judge that Maria does not have knowledge of the outcome.**, **In this scenario, although the proposition is true and believed by Maria, the belief did not result from an apt mental performance.**, **The scenario suggests that even if a belief is true and believed, an apt mental performance is not always what distinguishes knowledge from a lucky guess.**
