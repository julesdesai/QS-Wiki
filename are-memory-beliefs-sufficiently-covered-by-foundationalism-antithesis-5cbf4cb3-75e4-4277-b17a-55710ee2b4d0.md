## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person remembers their childhood home accurately. They believe this memory and it is true, yet it does not rest on current self-evident beliefs. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know their childhood home or they do not. If we say they know, memory beliefs suffice without foundational justification. If we say they do not know, it undermines the reliability of memory for knowledge.**
