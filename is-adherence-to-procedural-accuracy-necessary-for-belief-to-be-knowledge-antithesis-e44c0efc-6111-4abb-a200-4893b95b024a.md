## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a technician correctly diagnoses a problem by omitting some procedural steps but the belief is true and not inferred from any falsehood. Intuitively, we question whether skipping appropriate procedures detracts from labeling the belief as knowledge.**, **A plausible principle suggests that following accurate and systematic procedures is essential for a belief to transform into knowledge, questioning sufficiency claims without procedural accuracy.**
