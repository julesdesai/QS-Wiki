## Content

**Consider a scenario in which the same proposition is known in one context but unknown in another merely due to different conversational standards. Intuitively, it seems problematic to have knowledge attributed based on shifting contextual standards.**, **If context determines whether a proposition is known, then it implies that knowledge can fluctuate erratically with context, leading to potentially conflicting claims about the same proposition.**
