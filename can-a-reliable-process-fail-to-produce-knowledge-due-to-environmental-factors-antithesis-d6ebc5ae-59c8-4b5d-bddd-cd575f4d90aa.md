## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a GPS device known for accuracy while traveling in a region where poor satellite connection prevents the device from working correctly, leading to a wrong judgment of location. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know their location, despite using a process usually reliable.**, **It is implausible that the reliability of a process is immune to interference from environmental factors that impact its accuracy.**
