## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on a logical argument linking faulty premises. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know the proposition or that they do not know it. If we say they know the proposition, then we ignore the faulty premises. If we say they do not know it, then inferential justification alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
