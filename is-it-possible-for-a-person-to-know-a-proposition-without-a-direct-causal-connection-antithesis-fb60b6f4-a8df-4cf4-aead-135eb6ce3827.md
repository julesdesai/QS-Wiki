## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person makes a true prediction about a future event based solely on intuition with no causal evidence linking their belief to the outcome. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge of the event.**, **For a person to be said to know a proposition about a future event, it is generally considered necessary for there to be evidence or a reliable method connecting the belief to the event.**
