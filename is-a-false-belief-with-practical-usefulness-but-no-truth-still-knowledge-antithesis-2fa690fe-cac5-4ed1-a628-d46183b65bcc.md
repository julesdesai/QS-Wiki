## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a false proposition, but this belief has significant practical usefulness in guiding decisions. Intuitively, we would not regard this as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that practical usefulness does not compensate for the lack of truth when determining knowledge. This principle suggests that truth is more vital than practical consequences in constituting knowledge.**
