## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief through an intellectual virtue, yet, due to circumstances outside their control, they are correct by luck. Intuitively, this makes the belief difficult to categorize as knowledge.**, **It is plausible to think knowledge should be immune to luck, but the mere influence of an intellectual virtue does not guarantee an absence of epistemic luck.**
