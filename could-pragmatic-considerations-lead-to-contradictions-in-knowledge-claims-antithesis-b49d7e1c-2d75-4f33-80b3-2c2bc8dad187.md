## Content

**Suppose we have two individuals with contradictory beliefs that are both pragmatically beneficial within their own contexts. Intuitively, they both cannot have knowledge if their beliefs are incompatible.**, **The idea that pragmatic benefit can independently establish knowledge may lead to scenarios where contradictory beliefs are both considered knowledge, which is implausible.**
