## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, who is generally reliable at recognizing birds, mistakes a robotic replica of a robin for a real bird. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know there is a robin present despite the belief being produced by their reliable process of bird recognition.**, **It is implausible that knowing a fact is solely determined by the reliability of the belief-forming process. The environment or other factors may influence knowledge despite process reliability.**
