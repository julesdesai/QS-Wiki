## Content

**Reliabilism maintains that a belief formed by a reliable process constitutes knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person uses a reliable method for forming a belief that works well in their regular environment.**, **If this person is placed in a radically different environment where the reliable process fails to yield true beliefs, then relying solely on the process does not seem sufficient to claim the result as knowledge.**
