**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **The requirement for closeness of possible worlds is context-dependent with flexibility to include distant worlds**, **For knowledge, the truth needs to remain consistent in contextually defined relevant worlds**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient they believe the proposition, and it is true in these contextually determined worlds**
