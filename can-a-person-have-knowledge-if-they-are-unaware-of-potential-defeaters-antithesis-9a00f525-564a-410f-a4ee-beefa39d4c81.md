## Content

**There is a plausible principle that awareness of potential defeaters is not only key to knowledge but also affects judgements about what constitutes knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where someone holds a true belief and external justification suggests no defeaters, yet they remain unaware of possible defeaters present in their environment. Intuitively, it seems they lack full knowledge due to their ignorance of these defeaters.**
