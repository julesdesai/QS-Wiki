## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a belief is formed through epistemic virtues in a deceptive environment designed to lead individuals astray, yet the belief is true. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge whether the context affects the status of the belief as knowledge. If context affects the status, it implies that external factors beyond epistemic virtues can influence what counts as knowledge.**
