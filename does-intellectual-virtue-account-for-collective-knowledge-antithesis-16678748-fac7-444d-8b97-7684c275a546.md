## Content

**Consider a scenario where knowledge is attributed to a collective group, like a research team, where the outcome is a result of the group's combined efforts rather than any individual's intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we would judge that the group knows the result.**, **It is implausible to require a single individual's intellectual virtue for the group to have knowledge. This implausibility challenges whether intellectual virtue is a necessary or sufficient condition for knowledge within groups.**
