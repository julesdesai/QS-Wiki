## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a justified true belief resulting from a reliable process, yet the belief formation involves an element of luck, similar to classical Gettier problems. Intuitively, this does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the reliability condition can address Gettier-type scenarios where luck plays a role in possessing a true belief.**
