## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition derived from a dream which coincidentally aligns with a reliable cognitive process they usually follow when awake.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that even if the belief is true and coincides with the usual reliable process, the dream-derived belief fails to count as knowledge.**
