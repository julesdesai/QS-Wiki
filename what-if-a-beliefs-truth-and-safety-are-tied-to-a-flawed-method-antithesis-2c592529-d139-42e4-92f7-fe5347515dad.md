## Content

**A case in which someone believes a true proposition through a process that is unreliable in general, yet by coincidence produces true beliefs in the immediate environment. Intuitively, this is not knowledge because it rests on coincidence rather than a robust process.**, **It's implausible that a process generally producing false beliefs, despite being safe in particular cases, results in knowledge.**
