## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person forms a true belief based on reading an accurate but non-causal report, like a detailed historical event in an accurate book. Intuitively, we would say the person knows the historical fact even though their belief is not causally connected to the historical event.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge sometimes accrues through testimony and documentation not involving direct causal connections, but rather rests on reliable information channels.**
