## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition using flawed reasoning, yet the proposition is true, and their belief is sensitive to truth and not just lucky. Intuitively, improperly reasoned beliefs lack knowledge status.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing requires proper justification. A sensitivity and no-luck condition might allow poorly justified true beliefs to count as knowledge, conflicting with this principle.**, **It is implausible to equate flawed reasoning leading to true belief with genuine knowledge, as the epistemic merit is compromised.**
