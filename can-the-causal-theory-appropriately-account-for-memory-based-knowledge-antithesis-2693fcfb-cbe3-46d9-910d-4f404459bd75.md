## Content

**Suppose a person remembers a childhood event because they were frequently told about it, rather than directly recalling the actual event itself. Intuitively, this memory seems less reliable and less plausible as a basis for knowledge**, **The causal connection in such memory cases might be indirect and mediated through external accounts, raising concerns about whether the causal theory can adequately address claims of knowledge founded on memory**
