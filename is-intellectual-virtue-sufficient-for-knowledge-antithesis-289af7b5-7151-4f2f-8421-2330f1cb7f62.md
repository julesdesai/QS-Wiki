## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a person forms a belief through intellectual virtue, resulting in a true belief, yet the truth of the belief is coincidental and not causally connected to the virtue used. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say this constitutes knowledge.**, **There is a principle that the mere presence of an intellectual virtue and truth is insufficient for knowledge if the connection between the truth and the virtue is merely coincidental.**
