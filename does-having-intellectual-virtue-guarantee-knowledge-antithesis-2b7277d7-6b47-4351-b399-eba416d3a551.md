## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Alice, has a true belief formed through intellectual virtue about the current stock market trends, but coincidentally, the market behaves unpredictably contrary to her understanding. In this case, it seems Alice does not truly know the trends.**
**Suppose we have a case in which a true belief is held due to intellectual virtue, but external unpredictable events make the belief appear accurate without proper grounding in evidence. This does not satisfy the intuition that Alice has knowledge.**
**It is implausible that mere coincidence aligning a virtue-formed belief with truth suffices to establish knowledge.**
