## Content

**A person believes that their lottery ticket will not win because the odds are very low, and this belief is justified due to statistics and probabilities. However, even if it turns out that their belief is true because the ticket does not win, intuitively we would not say they know their ticket will lose, indicating a failure in claiming knowledge merely by justified true belief.**
