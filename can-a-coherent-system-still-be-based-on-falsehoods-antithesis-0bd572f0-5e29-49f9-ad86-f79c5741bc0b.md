## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a coherent belief system that is entirely constructed on false propositions but internally consistent. Intuitively, this coherence should not imply they have knowledge of any true propositions within the system.**, **A belief system can be internally coherent while still being entirely based on false premises.**, **It seems implausible that coherence alone guarantees the truth of the propositions within a system.**
