## Content

**Envision a scenario in which a person randomly guesses a coin flip correctly several times. Intuitively, the person has no knowledge of the outcomes despite having true beliefs.**, **The principle that knowledge requires simultaneous belief, truth, and reliability suggests such chance beliefs should count as knowledge when they are correct, which seems incorrect intuitively.**, **It is implausible to count random guesses as knowledge despite being true and believed, and thus challenges the theoretical view's sufficiency conditions.**
