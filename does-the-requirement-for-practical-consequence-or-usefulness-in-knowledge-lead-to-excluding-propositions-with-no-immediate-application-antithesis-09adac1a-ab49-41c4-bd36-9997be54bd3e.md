## Content

**Consider a proposition such as "There are an infinite number of prime numbers," which has no immediate practical consequence. Intuitively, we would judge that one can still know this proposition based on its truth and justified belief.**, **It is implausible that the lack of practical consequences or usefulness should exclude certain propositions from being known.**, **Suppose someone has a justified true belief in a mathematical theorem with no current practical application. Intuitively, we would have to say either they know the theorem or they do not. If we say they do not know it because of lack of practical consequence, it seems an arbitrary exclusion.**
