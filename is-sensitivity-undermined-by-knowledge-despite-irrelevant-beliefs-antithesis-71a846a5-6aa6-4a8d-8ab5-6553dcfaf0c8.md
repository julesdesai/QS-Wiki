## Content

**Individuals like Tamara may hold multiple beliefs about an event, such as an election outcome, relying on correct evidence but aware of incorrect gossip surrounding the straightforward situation who wins. Despite untruthworthy gossip, Tamara’s accurate prediction persists even if gossip suggests the contrary, she wouldn’t place full belief without the gossip. Intuitively, she knows what truly transpired, indicating sensitivity may overlook contextual disturbance from external incorrect beliefs.**, **Ignoring how unimportant beliefs might be misaligned with clear accurate ones. Tamara's dual knowledge of the event shows that sensitivity necessitates more precise tools to qualify varying mixed beliefs**
