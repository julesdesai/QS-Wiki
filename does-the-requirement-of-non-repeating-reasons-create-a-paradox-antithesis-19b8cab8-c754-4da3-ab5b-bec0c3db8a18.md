# Does the requirement of non-repeating reasons create a paradox?

## Content

**Consider a scenario where two reasons, A and B, are each dependent on C, yet must remain non-repeating. The principle of non-repetition implies that no reason can recur in the justification chain. This presents a paradox where any reason dependent on another cannot be repeated, making it difficult to form a coherent, non-repetitive infinite chain that reflects real justification processes.**
