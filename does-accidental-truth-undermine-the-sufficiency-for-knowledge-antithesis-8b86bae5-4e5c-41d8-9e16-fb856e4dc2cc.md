## Content

**Imagine someone predicts a natural disaster based solely on a random guess, which turns out to be accurate. The belief is true, justified in hindsight but initially random. Intuitively, we would judge that because the truth was an accident, the belief does not qualify as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot hinge on accidental coincidences. The element of chance undermines the sufficiency for true knowledge.**
