## Content

**A plausible principle is that knowledge is sometimes rooted in unquestioned practices or skills rather than explicit beliefs. This suggests knowledge might exist independently of explicit belief, akin to knowing how to balance on a bicycle without holding a conscious belief about doing so.**, **Suppose an expert in a domain acts consistently and appropriately within that domain based on skill or habit, but without holding a conscious belief about each specific decision. Intuitively, this person seems to possess knowledge despite the absence of articulated belief.**
