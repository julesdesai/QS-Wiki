## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition based on a specific set of evidence which makes alternatives highly unlikely, like a person believing a lottery ticket will lose. Intuitively, we either have to say they know the ticket will lose or not. If we say they know, then knowledge ignores possible alternatives.**, **For a belief to be sensitive, it must change if the proposition were false, and this requires considering plausible alternatives to current beliefs. If alternatives are ignored, sensitivity is not properly applied.**
