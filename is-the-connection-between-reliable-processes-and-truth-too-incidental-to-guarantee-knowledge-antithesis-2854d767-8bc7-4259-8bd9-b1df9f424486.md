## Content

**The causal connection refers to the specific relationship between a belief-forming process and the resulting belief's truth.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief that aligns with reality purely due to chance or coincidence, despite the process's reliability.**, **In such a scenario, if the connection is too incidental or coincidental, intuitively, it raises doubts about whether the belief qualifies as knowledge.**
