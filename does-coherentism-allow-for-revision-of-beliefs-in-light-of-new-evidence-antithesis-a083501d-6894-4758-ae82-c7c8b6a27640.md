## Content

**A coherentist approach might resist updating beliefs to accommodate new evidence if it disrupts the existing coherence**, **Consider a situation where a person encounters new, contradicting facts but dismisses them to preserve coherence in their beliefs**, **Intuitively, one would argue that such a rigid maintenance of coherence does not accommodate the growth of knowledge**
