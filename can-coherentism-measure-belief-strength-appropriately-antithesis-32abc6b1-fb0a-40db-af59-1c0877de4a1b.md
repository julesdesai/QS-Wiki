## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief strength varies within a coherent system but lacks proportional evidence.**, **Intuitively, such imbalance suggests the person may not actually have justified knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that justified beliefs must match the strength of their evidential support, not just coherence.**
