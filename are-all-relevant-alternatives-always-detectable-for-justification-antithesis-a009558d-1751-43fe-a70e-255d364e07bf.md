## Content

**Consider a scenario where it is impossible for a person to detect or consider certain relevant alternatives due to limitations in their evidence or understanding. Intuitively, this suggests a person might still know something even if not all alternatives are considered.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires considering alternatives that are beyond one's ability to detect or understand, challenging how the view articulates relevant alternatives.**
