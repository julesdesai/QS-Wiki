## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual believes a true scientific proposition read from a reputable source but doesnâ€™t understand the underlying science and thus cannot discern if the source's reasoning is reliable. Intuitively, we would hesitate to claim they possess knowledge.**, **The absence of the believer's insight into the reason why the belief is reliable challenges the claim that they truly know the proposition.**
