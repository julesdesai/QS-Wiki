## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition and seeks infinite justification. The regress problem suggests terminating justification with foundational beliefs, but the infinite chain proposal challenges this by only allowing endless reasoning.**, **A plausible principle is that justification should resolve or end in a way that is cognitively satisfying or explanatory. This principle together with the requirement for infinite chains would force explanations into an endless regress without resolution, which seems unsatisfactory epistemically.**
