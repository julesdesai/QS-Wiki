## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person forms a true belief absent-mindedly without relying on any premises or lemmas, true or false. Intuitively, we question if such belief really amounts to knowledge because it lacks deliberate cognitive engagement.**, **A person believing a true proposition in a way that completely circumvents reasoning structures (true or false) challenges the notion that simply having no false lemmas involved secures knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be attributed in a situation where belief is formed with no cognitive reasoning at all, even if the conclusion is true.**
