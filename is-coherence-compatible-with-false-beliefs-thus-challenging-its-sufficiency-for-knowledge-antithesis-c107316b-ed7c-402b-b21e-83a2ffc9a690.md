## Content

**Consider a situation where new evidence makes a coherent belief system outdated and mistaken. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that beliefs within the system fail to constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be based on widespread falsehoods. This principle suggests coherence may allow for false beliefs, questioning its sufficiency for knowledge.**
