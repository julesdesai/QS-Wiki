**Consider a scenario in which a person once knew the capital of a country, forgot it for a significant time period, and then remembered it. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the disruption in belief continuity affects their claim to current knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that continuous belief retention, without forgetting, is crucial for retaining knowledge through memory. This principle together with the scenario of forgetting and later remembering challenges the sufficiency of mere retention for knowledge.**, **The interruption and later restoration of memory challenge the idea that past accurate retention alone is sufficient for knowledge.**
