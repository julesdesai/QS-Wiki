**Consider a scenario in which a person believes in a proposition based on an unreliable but correct source, such as a notoriously inaccurate news outlet that happens to report accurately this time. The proposition is true, and most nearby worlds in which they believe it report similarly. The reliance on an unreliable source challenges intuitions about whether they truly know it, despite meeting the conditions of belief, truth, and safety.**
