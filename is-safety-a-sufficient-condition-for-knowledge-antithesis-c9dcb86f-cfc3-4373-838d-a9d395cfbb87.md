## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows that it is raining because they see raindrops on the window, their belief is true, and in nearby possible worlds where the person sees raindrops, it is always raining. If the raindrops are fake or part of a film set in some nearby worlds, intuitively, we would judge that the belief is not safely true despite appearing safe in most worlds.**, **It is implausible that a belief can qualify as knowledge merely by being safe in most nearby worlds if there are significant exceptions where the belief-forming process is unreliable.**
