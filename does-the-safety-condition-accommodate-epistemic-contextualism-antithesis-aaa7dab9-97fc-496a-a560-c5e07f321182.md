**In a context where the bar for what constitutes knowledge is raised due to high stakes, a person's belief meets the safety condition but is still doubted.**, **The belief could not easily have been false but might still lack the credibility required in this context for knowledge.**, **This indicates that safety may not fully address the variability of knowledge claims across different contexts.**
