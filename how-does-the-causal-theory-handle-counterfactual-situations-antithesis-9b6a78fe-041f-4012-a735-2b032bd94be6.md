## Content

**Consider a scenario where if a critical causal element were different, a person, Jonah, could still maintain the same belief, and the belief would still be true. Intuitively, we would judge that Jonah retains knowledge under such counterfactual conditions, suggesting difficulties for the causal theory in rigid causality requirements.**
