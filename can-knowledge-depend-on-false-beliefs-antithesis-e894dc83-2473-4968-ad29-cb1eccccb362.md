## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on a false belief that logically implies the true proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the true proposition.**, **A case where a belief is true due to a chain of reasoning involving falsehoods is not a case of knowledge.**, **If knowledge required counterfactual dependence on true premises only, then beliefs reliant on false assumptions cannot constitute knowledge.**
