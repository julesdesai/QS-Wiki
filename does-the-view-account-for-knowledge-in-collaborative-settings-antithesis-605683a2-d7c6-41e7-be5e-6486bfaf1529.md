## Content

**In a collaborative research team, a single member may have significant knowledge due to reliance on other experts' intellectual virtues rather than their own. Intuitively, this seems sufficient for knowledge in such a context.**, **There is a plausible principle that in team endeavors, individuals may have knowledge by coordinating with others' intellectual virtues. This principle challenges the view that personal intellectual virtue is always necessary for knowledge.**
