## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a belief they deem self-evident, such as moral truths, which varies across different cultures. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that self-evidence is subjective.**, **There is a plausible principle that beliefs which seem self-evident can be culturally or personally biased. This principle suggests that self-evidence might not ensure universal validity or knowledge.**
