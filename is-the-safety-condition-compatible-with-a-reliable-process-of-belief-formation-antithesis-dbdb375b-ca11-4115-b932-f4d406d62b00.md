## Content

**Consider a reliable process that consistently leads a person to form true beliefs about nearby events. Intuitively, this process should lead to knowledge even if some nearby possible worlds make the belief false.**, **The emphasis on nearby possible worlds in the safety condition might conflict with the existence of reliable belief-forming processes.**, **If the safety condition is incompatible with reliable processes, then it undermines the value of reliability in acquiring knowledge.**
