## Content

**Suppose we have a conversation between two people in different contexts. One asserts they "know" something while the other challenges this based on higher contextual standards. Intuitively, successful communication requires some stable ground of knowledge standards.**, **There is a plausible principle that discourse presupposes a shared understanding of justification standards that could be violated by excessive contextual shifts.**
