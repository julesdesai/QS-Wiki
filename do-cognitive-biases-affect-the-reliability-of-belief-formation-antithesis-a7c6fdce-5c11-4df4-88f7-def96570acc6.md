## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief based on cognitive biases like confirmation bias, leading to a true belief, and the bias-driven process seems regularly reliable in offering true beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that such a belief produced by cognitive biases does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a reliable process should avoid systematic errors or biases when forming beliefs. Cognitive biases which sometimes lead to true beliefs challenge the sufficiency of just reliable processes for knowledge.**
