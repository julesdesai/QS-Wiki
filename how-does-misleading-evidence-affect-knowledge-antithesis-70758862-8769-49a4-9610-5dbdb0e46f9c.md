## Content

**Consider a case where an individual has a true belief, but the individual's belief was formed by looking at misleading evidence that could have easily led them to a false belief. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the individual does not know the proposition.**, **For knowledge to depend counterfactually on the truth, the absence of misleading evidence should weaken the claim to knowledge.**, **If misleading evidence that doesn't affect the truth of the proposition affects knowledge, then counterfactual dependence may not suffice for knowledge.**
