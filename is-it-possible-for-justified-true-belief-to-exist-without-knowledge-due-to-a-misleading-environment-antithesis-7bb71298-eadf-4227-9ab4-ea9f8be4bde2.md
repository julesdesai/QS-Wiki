## Content

**Consider a case where a person, in a world where deceptive elements prevail like fake barns in a "barn fa√ßade" county, believes a barn exists based on seeing it. Intuitively, we might judge that the belief is not knowledge because the environment makes the belief accidentally true.**, **There is a plausible principle stating that knowledge cannot merely be a product of fortunate coincidence in an unreliable environment, opposing the sufficiency of justified true belief.**
