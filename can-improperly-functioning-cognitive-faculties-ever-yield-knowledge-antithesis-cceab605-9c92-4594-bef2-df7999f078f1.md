## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a cognitive glitch that consistently leads to true beliefs about their immediate environment without the person being aware of the glitch. Intuitively, one might judge that the person knows these true beliefs despite the glitch.**, **It is plausible to consider that true beliefs obtained consistently, even through malfunctioning faculties, can still count as knowledge. If so, the necessity of properly functioning faculties is undermined.**
