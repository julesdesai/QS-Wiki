## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person reads about a scientific fact in a highly reliable textbook and forms a belief based on that information. In this scenario, even if the fact were false, the person would still believe it because they trust the textbook. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the fact despite their belief not being sensitive to its truth.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should involve being connected to the truth of the matter. However, reliance on a source usually considered trustworthy could lead to situations where the principle of sensitivity is violated yet knowledge is still ascribed.**
