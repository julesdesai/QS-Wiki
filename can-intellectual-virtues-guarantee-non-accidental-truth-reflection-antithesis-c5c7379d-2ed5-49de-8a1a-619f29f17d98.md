## Content

**It is plausible that a person can hold a belief that reflects the truth accidentally, despite the exercise of intellectual virtues.**, **Consider a scenario where someone has a reliable intuition that often leads to true beliefs; however, in a particular case, their truth is due to an unexpected factor, like a coincidence.**, **In such a case, intuitively, we would judge that their belief does not constitute knowledge, as it hinges too much on accident rather than virtue.**
