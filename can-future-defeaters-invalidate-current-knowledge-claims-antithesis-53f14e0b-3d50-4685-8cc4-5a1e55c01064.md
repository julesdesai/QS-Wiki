## Content

**Suppose a person has a justified true belief with no known defeaters but later discovers evidence that defeats their justification. Intuitively, the claim to knowledge seems undermined when such a defeater is found, suggesting the initial belief may not have been genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that the discovery of future defeaters can retroactively affect the status of knowledge. This principle challenges the sufficiency of justified true belief with no defeaters for knowledge.**
