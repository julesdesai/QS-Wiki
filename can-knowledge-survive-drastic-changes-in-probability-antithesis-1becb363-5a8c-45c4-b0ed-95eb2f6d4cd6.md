## Content

**Imagine someone who confidently predicts an event based on current data, but due to immediate contextual changes, the probability of the event drastically drops. Intuitively, their prior belief might no longer qualify as knowledge.**, **Events hinging on rapidly fluctuating probabilities suggest that fluctuating circumstances may impact the reliability aspect envisioned by safety.**, **Dynamic variables altering probabilistic outcomes challenge knowledge claims predicated on ephemeral safety conditions.**
