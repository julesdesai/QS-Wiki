## Content

**Consider a scenario where belief results from factors like reliability or truth-conduciveness rather than intellectual virtue, such as trusting a reliable thermometer for temperature. Intuitively, we would judge that such cases can constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable belief-forming processes should also be considered in accounts of knowledge. This principle challenges the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
