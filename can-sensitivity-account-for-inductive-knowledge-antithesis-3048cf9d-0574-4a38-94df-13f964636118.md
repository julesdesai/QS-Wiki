## Content

**Consider any case where one forms a belief based on reliable inductive reasoning; the proposition may still be false despite following evidence patterns. In such a case, intuitively, sensitivity struggles to incorporate the nature of inductive reasoning.**, **In scenarios relying primarily on evidence strength rather than sensitivity, intuitively, such reasoning reflects knowledge.**
