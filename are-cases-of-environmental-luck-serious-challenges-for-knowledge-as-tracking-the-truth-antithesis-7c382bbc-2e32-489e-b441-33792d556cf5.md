## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a belief that tracks the truth, but the correctness of this tracking is due to a helpful but unseen environmental factor. Intuitively, we might judge this to be a case of luck rather than knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a belief's truth-tracking due to luck, such as favorable environmental conditions, is sufficient for knowledge. This puts pressure on the sufficiency claim of the tracking view.**
