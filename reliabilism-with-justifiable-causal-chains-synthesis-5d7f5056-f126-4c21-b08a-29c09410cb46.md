**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief is produced by a reliable process**, **Reliable processes involve justifiably strong causal links, though not necessarily infinite**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their belief arises from a reliable causally justifiable process**
