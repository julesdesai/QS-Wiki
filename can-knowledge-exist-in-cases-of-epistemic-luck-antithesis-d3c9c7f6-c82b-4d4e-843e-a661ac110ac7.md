**Consider a scenario where a person, Alex, believes it will rain because they saw a forecast, which erroneously predicted rain due to a malfunction, yet it rains because unrelated meteorological conditions align. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that Alex does not truly know it will rain despite their belief being true.**, **The necessity of the belief not being true due to epistemic luck means that if the belief's truth was merely contingent upon unforeseen factors, it challenges the sufficiency of true belief without luck for defining knowledge.**, **It seems plausible to assert that Alex's belief being true because of a malfunction challenges the role of epistemic luck, thus undermining the completeness of the 'Anti-Luck Condition' as sufficient for knowledge.**
