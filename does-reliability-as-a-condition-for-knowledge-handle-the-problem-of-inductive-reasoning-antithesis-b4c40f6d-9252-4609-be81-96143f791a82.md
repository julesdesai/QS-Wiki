## Content

**Consider a case where a scientist predicts based on historical data and reliable statistical analysis that a planet will align next year, forming a justified belief.**, **The reliability of the inductive method grants the scientist's belief a solid epistemic foundation, yet it is possible for the prediction to fail due to unforeseen astronomical anomalies.**, **Reliabilism struggles to incorporate the uncertain nature of inductive reasoning into its account of when beliefs constitute knowledge.**
