## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a belief is formed by a process that generally leads to true beliefs but is unreliable on rare occasions. It is implausible that we can precisely define reliability across all contexts, leading to vagueness in application.**, **Suppose we evaluate a situation where reliability is questioned; intuitively, the vagueness in defining what constitutes a reliable process would undermine the judgment of knowledge.**
