## Content

**In a case where a person believes a true proposition after randomly guessing, such as predicting the outcome of a dice roll, the belief happens to be true.**, **The belief is true in this instance and could not easily have been false due to chance.**, **Despite meeting the safety condition, intuitively, this case does not amount to knowledge, suggesting that the condition may not effectively address epistemic luck.**
