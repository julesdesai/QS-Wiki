## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on evidence that is accidentally but not reliably correct. In such a scenario, intuitively we would not consider this belief to constitute knowledge.**, **There are scenarios where a belief is true and remains true in nearby possible worlds, yet we are hesitant to say it qualifies as knowledge due to the accidental correctness of the evidence.**
