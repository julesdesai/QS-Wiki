## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition based on adequate reasons, but they lack introspective access to their reasoning process. Intuitively, we might question whether they truly know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge involves a degree of self-awareness and understanding of the reasons for one's belief. This principle suggests that without awareness, what one claims to know could be questioned.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition that is true, but their belief is formed subconsciously and they are unaware of this. Intuitively, if they lack awareness of their cognitive process, it is unclear whether they truly possess knowledge.**
