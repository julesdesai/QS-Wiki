## Content

**There is a plausible principle that not all true beliefs qualify as knowledge even if there are no known defeaters.**, **Imagine a situation where a person guesses correctly on a multiple-choice question, the answer is true, and no defeaters exist.**, **Intuitively, the guess lacks the epistemic weight to be considered knowledge.**
