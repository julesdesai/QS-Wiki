## Content

**Suppose a person believes their friend lives in Berlin because their friend told them so, a true proposition. There is also a true but unknown proposition that the friend is planning to move to Paris soon, which constitutes a defeater for the person's justification of the belief.**, **The practical implication that a person's knowledge depends on awareness of all defeaters leads to hypothetical and often intractable scenarios, making it difficult to claim any meaningful knowledge.**, **Knowledge becomes contingent on an ever-changing set of possible defeaters, leading to paradoxes where knowledge might retroactively be denied.**
