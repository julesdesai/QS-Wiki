## Content

**Imagine a person believes a door is locked because they see a keychain indicating the key is inside the house, but the door remains unlocked accidentally. In some possible worlds, the door could be locked. Intuitively, the belief doesn't track the truth due to inconsistencies across worlds.**, **Truth-tracking suggests stability of belief in similar scenarios, which isn't apparent here due to variability in truth across close possible worlds.**
