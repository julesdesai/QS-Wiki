## Content

**Imagine a person who believes a rumor which turns out to be true, but the evidence that led them to believe it was misleading or non-factual. Intuitively, their belief does not constitute knowledge despite its truth.**, **While such a belief might satisfy the Safety Condition due to not being easily false, it does not align with the intuitive requirement for knowledge to be based on credible evidence.**
