## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justification for a belief can vary independently of the process reliability if outcome luck plays a significant role.**, **Consider a scenario where someone makes a correct prediction about a coin flip based on a reliable but irrelevant pattern, such as the previous flip sequence. Intuitively, we would say that the true belief lacks justification and therefore cannot be regarded as knowledge, regardless of reliability.**
