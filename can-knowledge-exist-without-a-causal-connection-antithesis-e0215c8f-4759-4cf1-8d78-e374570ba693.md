## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person, Jamie, flips a coin, and it lands heads up due to an unpredictable gust of wind. Jamie had believed it would land heads based on no specific evidence. The belief and truth are coincidental. Intuitively, Jamie does not know the coin would land heads because there is no causal connection.**, **This suggests that mere truth and belief without causal connection can lead to coincidental truths rather than knowledge.**
