## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows a fact in a benign environment, but would hold the same belief in a non-benign similar environment where the fact is false. In such a scenario, the person's belief seems sensitive to their environment rather than the truth.**, **Intuitively, external conditions impacting sensitivity challenge whether sensitivity is crucial to knowledge.**
