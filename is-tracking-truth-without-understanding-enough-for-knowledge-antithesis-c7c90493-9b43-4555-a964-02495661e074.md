## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person, by chance, gets every question on a test right without understanding the material. They would not believe a wrong answer, yet this belief tracks truth. Intuitively, understanding seems crucial for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that mere tracking of truth is insufficient for knowledge without comprehension or understanding of the subject matter.**
