**Suppose a person believes a proposition because of a reliable source that they have no reason to doubt.**, **If, in nearby possible worlds, the reliable source fails in a trivial or rare way, they would still believe the proposition.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person possesses knowledge despite some beliefs being unsafe.**
