## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual's beliefs form a highly coherent system due to a powerful delusion or systematic error. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person's coherent beliefs justify knowledge or that knowledge requires more than coherence. If we say coherent beliefs justify knowledge, then knowledge could be based on systemic error or delusion. If we say knowledge requires more than coherence, then coherence is not sufficient for justification.**, **It is implausible that coherence can reliably connect belief with truth, since coherence can occur independently of any connection to reality.**
