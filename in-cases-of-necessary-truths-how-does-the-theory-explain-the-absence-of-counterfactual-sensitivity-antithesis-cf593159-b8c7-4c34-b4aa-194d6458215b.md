**Consider a scenario in which someone believes that for any even number greater than two, there are two prime numbers that add up to it (Goldbach's Conjecture). The belief seems not to require counterfactual sensitivity since the proposition's status as a necessary truth remains unaffected by beliefs about it.**, **For necessary truths, sensitivity is defined as belief being true in all possible worlds. This principle does not demand counterfactual sensitivity as there are no possible worlds where a necessary truth is false.**, **It is implausible that sensitivity as defined in the theory can provide insights into cases where no world exists where the proposition is false, as such cases inherently lack counterfactual conditions.**
