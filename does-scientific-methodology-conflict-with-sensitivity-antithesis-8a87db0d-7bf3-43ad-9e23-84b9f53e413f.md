## Content

**Suppose we have scientists forming beliefs about a theory based on reproducible experimental results and consensus. Intuitively, we conclude science provides knowledge about the world.**, **There is a plausible principle that scientific consensus provides a reliable basis for knowledge. Yet, the sensitivity requirement implies that scientific beliefs fail as knowledge because some false empirical data could still produce consistent agreement and belief, introducing doubt about scientific knowledge.**
