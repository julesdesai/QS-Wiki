## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone forms a belief based on unconscious, instinctual processes rather than deliberate reasoning. Nonetheless, the belief is true and reliably formed. Intuitively, one might argue that intellectual virtues do not always require conscious, deliberate reasoning.**, **It is implausible that only conscious, deliberate reasoning can be considered an intellectual virtue. This challenges the notion that all knowledge must arise from such a process.**
