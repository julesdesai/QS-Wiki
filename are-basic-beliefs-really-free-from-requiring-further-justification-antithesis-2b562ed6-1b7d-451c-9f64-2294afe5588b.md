## Content

**There is a plausible principle that all beliefs need some form of justification, either inferential or non-inferential. This principle together with the claim that basic beliefs do not require justification entails that basic beliefs are an exception to a general requirement on beliefs, thereby potentially leaving them as unjustified dogmas.**, **Consider the scenario of an individual who claims to have a basic belief based merely on its seeming true intuitively. Intuitively, one might judge such belief as lacking proper justificatory grounds despite its classification as basic, raising doubts about its justification-free status.**
