## Content

**Suppose a person P mirrors another’s belief due to mimicry without understanding and the belief is true. Intuitively, it appears P does not have knowledge due to lack of understanding, despite the idea that the truth was not due to luck but externally driven by another’s knowledge.**, **This challenges the broader conception of the anti-luck condition by exposing potential reliance on another's virtue or competence rather than the individual's.**
