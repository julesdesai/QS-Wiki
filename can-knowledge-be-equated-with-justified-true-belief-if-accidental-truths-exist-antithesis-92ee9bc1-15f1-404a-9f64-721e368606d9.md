**Consider a scenario where a person Mary has a belief that it is raining because she sees people with wet umbrellas coming inside. It turns out, unbeknownst to Mary, someone just sprayed water on the umbrellas for a prank. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Mary does not know it is raining despite having a justified true belief.**
