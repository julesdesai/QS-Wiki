## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be objective enough to avoid excessive relativism. If justification and, by extension, knowledge truth-claims can change with context, an unsettling relativism might result.**, **Consider a scenario where two people are in different contexts discussing the same proposition. One knows it, while the other doesn't due to differing justifications, raising the question of whether both can be right simultaneously.**
