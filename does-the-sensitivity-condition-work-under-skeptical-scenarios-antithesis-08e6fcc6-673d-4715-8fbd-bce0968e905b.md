## Content

**Imagine a scenario where an evil demon deceives someone into falsely believing all their sensory experiences are true. Intuitively, the sensitivity condition becomes problematic as it relies on actual falsity rather than hypothetical deception, leading to potential skepticism about most knowledge claims.**, **This scenario elucidates a tension between sensitivity's reliance on falsity and our non-skeptical intuition that we have some knowledge despite misleading scenarios.**
