## Content

**Suppose a person has a deeply ingrained but seemingly irrational belief that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow, without recalling their original justification for it. Intuitively, they might still be said to know this fact based on common sense observations and experience**, **The requirement of having justification for every known proposition might clash with practical instances of retained knowledge without the current ability to articulate justifications**
