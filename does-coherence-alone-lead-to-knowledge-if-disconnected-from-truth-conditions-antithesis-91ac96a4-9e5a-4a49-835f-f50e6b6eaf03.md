## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs, yet some beliefs in that system are false. Intuitively, this coherence might not transmit truth to the cohereing belief.**, **It is instinctive to think that a mere coherence without consideration of truth in interconnected beliefs challenges the sufficiency of the conditions for knowledge.**
