## Content

**Suppose we have a person who unknowingly uses a reliable method to form true beliefs, such as a student who accidentally studies exactly the right material for an exam. Intuitively, there may be hesitation to say they know the material well.**, **It is implausible to think that the sufficiency of external truth-conducive connections alone constitutes knowledge if the individual lacks awareness of using a reliable method. This implausibility suggests awareness might play a role in the sufficiency for claiming knowledge.**
