## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on a clear and present experience that accurately represents reality. It is uncertain how to measure the 'safety' of this belief because variations in perception and circumstance are not uniformly measurable across possible worlds.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief must remain true to be considered 'safe' across nearby possible environments. This principle, however, is undermined by fluctuating conditions within possible worlds, leading to potential errors in judgment.**
