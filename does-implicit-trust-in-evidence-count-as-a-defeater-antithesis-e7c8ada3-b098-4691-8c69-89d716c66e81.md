## Content

**Suppose a person trusts the testimony of a reliable friend about a personal experience being true, believing the statement genuinely reflects knowledge. Intuitively, this trust seems to underwrite knowledge in the absence of known errors.**, **Consider, however, that the friend is sincerely mistaken due to a minor but critical logical error in their reasoning which serves as an unnoticed defeater. Intuitively, the person relying on their friend's testimony does not know.**, **According to the no-defeaters clause, their trust without knowledge of the error fulfills knowledge conditions, contrasting with the intuition that undiscovered errors in reasoning impact the status of belief as knowledge.**
