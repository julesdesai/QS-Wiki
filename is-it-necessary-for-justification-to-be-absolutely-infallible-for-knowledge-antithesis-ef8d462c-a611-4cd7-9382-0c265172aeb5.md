## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person P has a highly reliable but not infallible source for their belief, such as sensory perception. Intuitively, we would judge that P can still have knowledge under these conditions.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be fallible, allowing some degree of uncertainty in justification.**, **The assumption that justification must be infallible for knowledge appears to challenge practical conceptions of knowing.**
