## Content

**It is plausible that reliability-enhanced justification for a belief should withstand the presence of relevant justified false beliefs that could potentially undermine a claim to knowledge. Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition through a reliable cognitive process, like a detective concluding a suspect is guilty based on strong but ultimately misleading evidence against other suspects. Intuitively, despite the reliability of the process that led to the belief, the presence of justified (but false) beliefs about the evidence for other suspects suggests a lack of true knowledge due to the undermining context.**, **A justified belief in the truth of a proposition, when accompanied by relevant justified false beliefs, can intuitively challenge the sufficiency of reliability alone in constituting genuine knowledge.**
