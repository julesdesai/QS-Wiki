## Content

**Suppose we consider a situation where a person was once convinced of a proposition but has since forgotten their belief. When quizzed, they answer correctly, appearing to have latent or dormant knowledge without actively holding the belief. Intuitively, it seems plausible to say they have knowledge due to memorized correctness rather than belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests latent knowledge can exist independently of active belief. This challenges the necessity of continuously held beliefs for knowledge claims.**
