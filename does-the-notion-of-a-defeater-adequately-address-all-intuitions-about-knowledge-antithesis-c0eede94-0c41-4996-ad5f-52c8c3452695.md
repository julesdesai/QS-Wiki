## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified belief in who will win an election based on reliable poll data. If a last-minute event drastically changes voting outcomes, the belief is no longer true.**, **If the individual was never aware of the last-minute event, intuitively they did not know who would win despite having a justified belief.**, **This suggests that the existence of defeaters should include potential unknown events that would affect the belief's truth.**
