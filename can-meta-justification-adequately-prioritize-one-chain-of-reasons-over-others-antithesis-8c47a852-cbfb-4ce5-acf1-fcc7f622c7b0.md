## Content

**A meta-justification is supposed to explain why a particular infinite chain of reasons is preferable to other possible chains.**, **Multiple equally infinite chains of reasons could potentially justify a belief, making it unclear how one can effectively prioritize one over another with a meta-justification.**, **The difficulty or impossibility of adequately applying meta-justification to infinite chains undermines the coherence of using meta-justification to establish knowledge.**
