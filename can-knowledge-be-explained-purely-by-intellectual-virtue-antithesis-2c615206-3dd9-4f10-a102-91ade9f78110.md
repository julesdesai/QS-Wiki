## Content

**It is possible for a person to have a true belief that results from intellectual virtues but still lack specific knowledge about the subject matter, thereby casting doubt on the sufficiency of intellectual virtues alone for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person uses reliable faculties to achieve a true belief about the winning number of a lottery, despite lacking insight into how the numbers were generated.
