## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is true and justified at the beginning but a disruption occurs in the causal chain leading to the actual belief formation. Intuitively, the belief seems to lack the consistency required for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a continuous causal chain is necessary for knowledge. This principle implies that any interruption in the chain invalidates the claim to knowledge.**
