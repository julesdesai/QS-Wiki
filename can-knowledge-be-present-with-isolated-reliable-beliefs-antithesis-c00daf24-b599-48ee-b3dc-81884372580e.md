## Content

**Suppose a case in which a person has a true belief formed by a reliable cognitive process, such as using a well-calibrated thermometer to find out the temperature. Intuitively, if this belief about the temperature is the only reliable belief the person has among many other unreliable beliefs, we have to either accept that this isolated reliability does not constitute knowledge because it lacks integration with the person's other beliefs or concede that knowledge is not truly a unified body cognitive achievement.**, **Knowledge is often understood as having a degree of coherence among one's beliefs, implying that isolated reliable beliefs may lack the integration with other beliefs required for true knowledge.**
