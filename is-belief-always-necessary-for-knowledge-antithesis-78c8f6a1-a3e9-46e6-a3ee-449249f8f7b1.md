**There are cases where it is intuitive to say someone knows something even if they do not actively believe it, such as a forgetful scientist who remembers a fact during a test without actively believing it beforehand.**, **It is plausible that knowing a proposition involves a disposition to act appropriately in relevant contexts, which may not require belief in the traditional sense.**
