**Imagine a case where a person believes a weather forecast predicting sunshine, but the forecast is inaccurate; it just happens to be sunny by chance. The intuition is that the person does not really know it will be sunny, even though they believe correctly.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge involves sensitivity, where the belief ceases if the proposition is false. However, accidental true beliefs suggest sensitivity is not necessary, as the belief persists independently of the forecast's accuracy.**, **It is implausible to suggest that sensitivity alone can account for knowledge, as it neglects the potential for accidentally true beliefs derived from unreliable sources.**
