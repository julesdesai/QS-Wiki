## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person sees a red apple and believes it is a red apple because of direct perception. Intuitively, the belief appears justified independently of its coherence with other beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs, like perceptual beliefs, do not require coherence with other beliefs for justification. This principle suggests coherentism may miss an essential aspect of perceptual knowledge.**
