## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition because it is pragmatically beneficial, but the proposition is false. Intuitively, we would say that the person does not have knowledge in this case.**, **A case in which a belief is false challenges the notion that pragmatic benefit can compensate for falsehood in constituting knowledge.**
