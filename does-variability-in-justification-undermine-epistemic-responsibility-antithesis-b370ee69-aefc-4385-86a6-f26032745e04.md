## Content

**Imagine a scenario where different contexts permit varying and potentially lower standards of evidence for justification. In such settings, individuals might feel justified in believing propositions with insufficient support compared to stringent standards.**, **There is a plausible principle that epistemic responsibility involves adhering to high standards of evidence to avoid error. Context-dependent justification could conflict with this principle by allowing beliefs that wouldn't meet more rigorous standards.**
