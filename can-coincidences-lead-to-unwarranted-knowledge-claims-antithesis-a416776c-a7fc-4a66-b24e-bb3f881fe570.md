## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario in which a person, while sleep talking, utterers a proposition that happens to be true, though the utterance results from random neural firing and sleep states. These states are not processes epistemically geared towards producing truth. Intuitively, it appears inappropriate to ascribe knowledge of the proposition to the person.**
