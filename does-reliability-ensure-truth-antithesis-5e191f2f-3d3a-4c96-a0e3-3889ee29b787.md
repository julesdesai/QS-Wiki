**It is implausible that merely having a generally reliable cognitive process guarantees truth in every specific instance.**, **Consider a scenario where a belief is formed reliably but due to an unusual malfunction temporarily yields a false belief that is corrected by luck. Intuitively, we would say that the person does not have genuine knowledge despite the normally reliable process.**
