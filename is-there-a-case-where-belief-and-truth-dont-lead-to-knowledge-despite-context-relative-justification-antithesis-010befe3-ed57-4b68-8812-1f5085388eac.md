## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition based on misleading evidence that only seems reliable in their context. Intuitively, we might say the person does not have knowledge despite their belief being true and justified according to their context.**, **A person can be justified in their context due to misleading evidence, which calls into question whether all context-relative justifications lead to knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that reliable evidence should not contradict other widely accepted evidence, suggesting that context-relative justification might not be sufficient for knowledge.**
