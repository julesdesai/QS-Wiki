## Content

**Suppose a system of beliefs consists of numerous interconnected propositions, some justified indirectly. Intuitively, the complexity of justification might permit knowledge despite initial false lemmas.**, **In intricate epistemic structures, focusing solely on the absence of false lemmas may overlook how broader justification networks yield knowledge.**
