## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a child believes that their parents will come home based on routine without understanding underlying reasons. Intuitively, it seems they possess knowledge even if their cognitive process is simple and arguably unreliable by adult standards.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should account for age-appropriate processes without necessitating complex reliability assessments. This suggests that an overly stringent reliability condition might dismiss genuine cases of knowledge.**
