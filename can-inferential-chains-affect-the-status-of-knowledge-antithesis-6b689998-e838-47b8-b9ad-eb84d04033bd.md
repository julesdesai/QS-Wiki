## Content

**Consider a scenario where person P infers Q from P using valid logic, and both propositions are true. Even if P is justified in believing P and infers Q correctly, intuitively, an error in basic fact-checking on P's side might mean P does not know Q, although P believes it.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge through inference depends on the knowledge of initial premises. This principle together with valid inference does not guarantee knowledge of Q if the belief in P is flawed.**
