## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on reliable information that also supports a closely related false proposition. Intuitively, the person lacks knowledge because their belief could easily have been a false belief.**, **If it is necessary for knowledge that if the proposition were false, the person would not believe it, then believing a closely related false proposition undermines the sensitivity condition.**
