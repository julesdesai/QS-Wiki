## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which evidence for a proposition fluctuates frequently. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person maintains a stable belief despite changing evidence or that such fluctuations disrupt belief stability. If we say belief remains stable, it challenges the notion that belief depends on evidence. If we say belief is disrupted, stable belief becomes questionable.**
