**If knowledge is context-dependent, the reliability of knowledge claims can vary significantly between contexts.**, **A knowledge claim that is valid in one context may not hold in another if the contextual standards differ, which makes it hard to trust knowledge claims as stable truths.**, **This instability might undermine the general reliability people usually attribute to knowledge.**
