## Content

**Consider a scenario in which somebody's belief rests on an unverified rumor that turns out to be true, and the belief is not easily false in similar situations.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that the belief doesn't constitute knowledge because it lacks a solid evidential foundation, regardless of its truth and safety.**, **It is implausible to consider beliefs based on weak foundations as knowledge, even when they align with truth and safety.**
