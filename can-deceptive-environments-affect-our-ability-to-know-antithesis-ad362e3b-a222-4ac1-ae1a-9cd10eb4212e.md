## Content

**Suppose a person is in a museum with both authentic and expertly crafted fake paintings and believes a particular painting is authentic.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the painting is authentic if they cannot distinguish it from a fake.**, **Inability to distinguish from relevant alternatives, like the fakes, undermines the claim to knowledge of the painting's authenticity.**
