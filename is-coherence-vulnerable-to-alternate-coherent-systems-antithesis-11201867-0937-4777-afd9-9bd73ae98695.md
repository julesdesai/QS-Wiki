## Content

**Consider a situation where two systems of beliefs are individually coherent but contain mutually contradictory beliefs. Intuitively, both systems cannot represent knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot reside in contradictory belief systems. This principle together with the existence of alternate, equally coherent systems questions coherence's role in knowledge.**
