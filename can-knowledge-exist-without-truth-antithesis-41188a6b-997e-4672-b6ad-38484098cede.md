**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth.**, **Consider a case where someone has evidence that strongly supports a proposition, and they act successfully based on that proposition, but it later turns out to be false. In this scenario, intuitively, we might judge that the person had knowledge at the time despite the proposition being false.**
