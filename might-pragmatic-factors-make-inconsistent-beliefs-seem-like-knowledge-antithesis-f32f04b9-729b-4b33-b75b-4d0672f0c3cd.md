## Content

**Picture a scenario where a person holds inconsistent beliefs about two related medical claims, but adopts whichever belief is more pragmatically useful depending on the situation, like using different treatments that aren't scientifically compatible but effectively aid patients. Intuitively, this adaptability could resemble knowledge, despite being inconsistent.**, **The idea that pragmatic usefulness does not affect knowledge is challenged if pragmatic adjustments allow the co-existence of inconsistent beliefs, which should traditionally undermine justified true beliefs, yet can appear to support knowledge through practical success.**
