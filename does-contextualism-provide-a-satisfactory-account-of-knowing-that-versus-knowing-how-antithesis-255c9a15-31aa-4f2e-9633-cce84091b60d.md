## Content

**Suppose a person claims to know how to ride a bike in a context demanding minimal justification.**, **In a different context, the same individual claims knowledge of a proposition demanding high justification, such as a theoretical math statement.**, **The context-sensitive justification leads to a disparity in knowledge attribution between knowing-how and knowing-that.**, **It is implausible for contextual standards to differ so markedly between knowing-how and knowing-that forms of knowledge.**
