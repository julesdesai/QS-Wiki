## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which two people form the same belief using the same reliable process, but only one has additional information or evidence linking the belief to its truth. Intuitively, we may judge that only the person with the extra link possesses knowledge.**, **It is implausible that simply using a reliable process suffices for knowledge without considering the particular acquaintance an individual might have with the evidence or truth of the belief.**
