## Content

**Suppose a person deceives themselves into believing "I am happy," despite contrary evidence. Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge in such a scenario.**, **Even if the belief were incidentally true, the sensitivity condition fails to preclude leaning towards a falsity, undermining its adequacy in cases of self-deception.**
