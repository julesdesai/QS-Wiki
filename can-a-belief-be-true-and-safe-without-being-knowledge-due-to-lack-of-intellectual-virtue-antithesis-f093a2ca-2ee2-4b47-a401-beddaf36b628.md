## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a student guesses the correct answer to a math problem by pure chance. The answer is true and the student's belief would not easily have been false because they guessed randomly and no misleading factors were at play.**, **Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is knowledge or not. If we say it is knowledge, then it seems we ignore the role of intellectual virtue. If we say it is not knowledge, then the necessity of a belief not easily being false seems insufficient for knowledge on its own.**, **It is implausible to assign knowledge to a guess that lacks any intellectual virtue despite the truth and safety of the belief.**
