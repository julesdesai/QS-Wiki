## Content

**Suppose a person P knows a proposition Q at time T1 with no defeaters. At T2, new evidence that undermines the justification for Q becomes available to others, but not to P.**, **Intuitively, one might say that P no longer knows Q at T2 due to the intervening evidence, even if P remains unaware of this evidence.**, **This suggests that the state of knowledge is affected not only by current defeaters but potential changes in what counts as a defeater.**
