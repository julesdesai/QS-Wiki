## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, while sitting under a tree, believes that a branch has just fallen because they heard a loud noise, and this belief is true because a branch did fall. The loud noise had nothing to do with the falling of the branch but was merely coincidental. Such a scenario challenges the intuition that the person genuinely knows the branch fell**, **The causal connection between the fact and the belief in this case is coincidental rather than direct or appropriate, which problematizes the notion of the causal theory of knowledge suggesting this person knows the proposition**
