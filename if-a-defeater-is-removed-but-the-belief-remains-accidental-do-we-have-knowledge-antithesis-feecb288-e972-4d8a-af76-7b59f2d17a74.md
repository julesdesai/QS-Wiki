## Content

**Consider a case in which a person believes a true proposition through guessing, initially faces a defeater, but the defeater is removed by chance. Intuitively, we might judge that despite the absence of the defeater, the belief's status as a guess precludes it from being knowledge.**, **Knowledge intuitively requires a belief to be more than a lucky guess, even in the absence of defeaters.**
