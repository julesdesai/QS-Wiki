## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual trusts a source simply based on friendship rather than evidence or reasoning. Intuitively, we either have to say that this results in knowledge or it does not. If we say it results in knowledge, then we reduce knowledge to a matter of personal trust without objective criteria. If we say it does not result in knowledge, then it seems trust alone is insufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should involve more than just trusting a person, including reasoning and evidence to ensure reliability.**
