## Content

**Consider a situation where a person has a justified true belief due to their intellectual competence and yet intuitively we would not consider it knowledge because of the involvement of misleading evidence.**, **A person might have correct information about the time from a normally reliable clock that is accidentally accurate on one specific viewing, leading to the belief being true by luck.**, **These cases show that true belief from intellectual virtue might still fail to provide knowledge if the truth is obtained through epistemic luck.**
