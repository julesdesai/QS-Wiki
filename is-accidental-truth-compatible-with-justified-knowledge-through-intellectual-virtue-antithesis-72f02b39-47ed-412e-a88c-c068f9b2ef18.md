## Content

**Consider a person who accidentally encounters a truth about a situation while intending to reach a different, unrelated conclusion through their intellectual inquiry. Intuitively, even if they employ intellectual virtues, the accidental nature of the true belief may undermine the classification of this belief as knowledge.**, **It is plausible that accidental truths occur even in intellectual pursuits, indicating that achieving true belief by accident may not align with the necessity of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
