**Consider a scenario in which a person, Maria, believes she won the lottery because she sees her numbers announced on TV, and she has in fact won the lottery. In nearby possible worlds, the numbers remain the same, and Maria still believes she has won.**, **Consider another scenario where in a nearby possible world, the broadcast mistakenly shows Maria's numbers due to a technical error, leading her to falsely believe she won. In this world, Maria wouldn't qualify as knowing she won, despite meeting the tracking condition in the actual world.**, **It is implausible that Maria knows she won the lottery in the original scenario if her belief could be so easily false due to a technical error in nearly identical conditions.**
