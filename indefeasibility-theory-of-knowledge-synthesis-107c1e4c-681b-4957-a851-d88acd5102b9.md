## Content

**A person knows a proposition if and only if their justification for the belief cannot be defeated by further evidence**, **Indefeasibility requires consideration of potential objective disconfirming evidence**, **For a belief to be knowledge, it must remain true despite new evidence**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their justification is indefeasible**
