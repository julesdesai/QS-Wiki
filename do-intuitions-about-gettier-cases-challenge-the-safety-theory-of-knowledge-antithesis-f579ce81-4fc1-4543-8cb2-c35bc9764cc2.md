## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition through a justified inference, but due to an error or accident, the inference also supports a false proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that the true belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **In such cases, even nearby possible worlds where the belief is true do not provide the needed connection between evidence and truth, suggesting that having true beliefs in nearby worlds is not sufficient for knowledge.**
