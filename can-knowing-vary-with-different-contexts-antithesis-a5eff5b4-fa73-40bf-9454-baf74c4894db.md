## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person claims to know that a bank is open based on their memory from last week. In a low-stakes context, we might judge that the person knows the bank is open.**, **Consider the same scenario where the stakes are higher, such as needing to deposit a large sum of money to avoid penalties. In this high-stakes context, we might intuitively judge that the person does not know the bank is open.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge attribution should remain consistent across similar scenarios if justification standards are stable.**
