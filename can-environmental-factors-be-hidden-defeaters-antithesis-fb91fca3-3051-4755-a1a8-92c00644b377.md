## Content

**Envision a person who believes a rare bird species inhabits their area based on a solitary but clear sighting. Intuitively, assuming appropriate knowledge practices, they would be considered knowledgeable.**, **Now imagine an environmental change that eliminated these birds from the area shortly after their sighting, thus unknown to the person. This environmental shift acts as a defeater. Intuitively, we would not consider the person to know about the species' current presence.**, **The no-defeaters clause allows for belief to be knowledge given truth at the time and absence of known defeaters, conflicting with the intuition that significant undetected ecological shifts undermine claims to such knowledge.**
