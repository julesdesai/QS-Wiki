**Situations exist where an individual forms a true belief through a reliable process, but we intuitively hesitate to credit them with knowledge due to luck, such as guessing answers correctly on a test.**, **A true belief formed by a reliable process could still merely be coincidentally true, not because of the reliability of the process, thereby failing our intuition of knowledge.**
