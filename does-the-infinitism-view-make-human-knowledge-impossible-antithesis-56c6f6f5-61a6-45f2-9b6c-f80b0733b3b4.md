## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual is required to provide non-repeating infinite reasons for their belief to count as knowledge. In practical terms, humans have limitations that prevent them from comprehending or utilizing infinite chains of reasons, making such a requirement seemingly impossible to satisfy.**, **It is implausible that a feasible epistemic system for human beings involves the necessity of infinite justification chains, as this would mean that no human could ever truly have knowledge.**
