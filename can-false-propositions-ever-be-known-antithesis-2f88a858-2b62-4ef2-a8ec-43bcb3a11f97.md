## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person wholeheartedly believes a false proposition due to overwhelming evidence and reasoning, and their conclusion aligns perfectly with what would typically be required for knowledge if only the proposition were true. Intuitively, we might feel compelled to say that they "know," despite the proposition being false.**, **There is a plausible principle that a person who aligns with all traditional components of knowledge except for the truth of their belief still possesses some form of epistemic status akin to knowledge.**
