## Content

**Consider a scenario where a detective accurately concludes who committed a crime using several pieces of evidence, some of which are mistaken. Intuitively, we might still think the detective knows who committed the crime even if some pieces of evidence were false.**, **If a person reaches a true conclusion through a justified process that is mostly reliable, the presence of some false beliefs does not intuitively defeat the attribution of knowledge.**
