## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on solid evidence, and the proposition is true, but there exist unknown alternatives that are relevant. Intuitively, one might question whether the person really knows the proposition due to not ruling out these alternatives.**, **There is a plausible principle that to know a proposition, one must be able to rule out relevant alternatives; however, determining which alternatives are relevant is difficult because of their unknown nature.**
