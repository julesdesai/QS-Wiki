## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes in the existence of an external world based on reliable perception, but they cannot definitively rule out skeptical hypotheses such as being in a simulated reality. Intuitively, we might judge that having knowledge of the external world requires more than merely relying on generally reliable processes.**, **It is plausible that reliability alone, without addressing skeptical scenarios, is insufficient to account for the certainty we associate with knowledge, suggesting a gap in the reliabilist framework.**
