## Content

**Suppose someone knows a mathematical truth through reasoning alone, as opposed to empirical observation. Intuitively, this constitutes a priori knowledge.**, **Tracking conditions seem more naturally aligned with empirical verification, potentially marginalizing how we understand a priori knowledge.**
