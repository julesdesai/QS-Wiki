## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the validation of a reliable process cannot solely depend on human intervention for it to yield knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a machine forms true beliefs through a reliable process without human input. Intuitively, if a reliable process independent of human intervention yields true beliefs, questioning if it constitutes knowledge challenges the sufficiency of reliability alone.**
