## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is justified solely by coherence with an infinite chain of beliefs. Intuitively, we either have to say that this chain doesn’t actually terminate the regress problem or that coherence inherently solves it. If we say the chain doesn’t terminate the regress, then coherence isn’t truly resolving the issue. If we say coherence solves it, then we are potentially accepting unjustified premises as foundational.**
