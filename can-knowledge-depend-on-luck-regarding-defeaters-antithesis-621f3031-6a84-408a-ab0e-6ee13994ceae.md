## Content

**Suppose person P believes proposition Q, which is true, and through sheer luck, P never encounters a defeater, although defeaters exist.**, **Intuitively, cases that depend on luck, especially concerning defeaters, fail to confer true knowledge on P.**, **The role of luck in avoiding defeaters challenges the sufficiency of the defeasibility account for knowledge.**
