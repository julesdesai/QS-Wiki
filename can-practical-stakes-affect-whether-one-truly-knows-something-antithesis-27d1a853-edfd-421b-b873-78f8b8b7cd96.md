## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be independent of practical stakes. This principle together with varying justification requirements implies that knowledge is at risk of being pragmatically motivated and therefore unreliable.**, **In situations where practical outcomes affect the individual's standards for justification, intuitively, such motivations should not determine knowledge validity.**
