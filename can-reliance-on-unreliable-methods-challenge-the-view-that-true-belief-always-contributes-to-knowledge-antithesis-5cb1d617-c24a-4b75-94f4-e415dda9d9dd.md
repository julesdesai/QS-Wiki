## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses unreliable methods, like flipping a coin to decide an answer, and ends up with a true belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that the true belief contributes to knowledge or it does not. If we say it contributes, then this challenges the integrity of how we value knowledge. If we say it does not, then true belief cannot always contribute to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that true beliefs formed under unreliable conditions contribute to knowledge.**
