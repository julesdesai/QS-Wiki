## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, receives misleading evidence causing temporary disbelief, and then reverts back to believing the proposition when the evidence is corrected. Intuitively, we would judge that the person's knowledge fluctuated with their belief.**, **If a person temporarily disbelieves a proposition because of misleading evidence, it is plausible to claim that they do not maintain knowledge during periods of disbelief.**
