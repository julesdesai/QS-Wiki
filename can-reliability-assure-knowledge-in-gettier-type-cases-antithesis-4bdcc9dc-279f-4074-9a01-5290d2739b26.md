## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is formed by a reliable process, the belief is true, but the evidence for the belief is misleading, such as a person looking at an accurate clock that is stopped but randomly shows the correct time. Intuitively, we would not say this person has knowledge of the time despite the belief's truth and reliability.**, **There is a plausible principle insisting that Gettier-type alterations suggest that the sufficiency condition fails without accounting for accidental correctness or lack of appropriate connection between belief and truth.**
