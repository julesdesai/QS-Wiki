## Content

**Consider a case where a person sees what appears to be a real lifeguard performing a rescue operation at the beach, leading them to believe the beach is safe. The proposition that the beach is safe is true because there is indeed another lifeguard on duty, but the "lifeguard" they saw was an actor filming a movie. The belief that the beach is safe would not easily turn false in nearby possible situations because of the actual lifeguard presence. Intuitively, we sense that the person does not genuinely know the beach is safe due to the misleading justification for their belief.**
