## Content

**Suppose someone comes to hold a true belief through sheer luck, such as guessing or being told by an unreliable source, and yet this belief aligns exactly with what would be considered knowledge if it arose through intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we might judge that this belief could still count as knowledge in some sense even without intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible that intellectual virtue is always necessary for a belief to constitute knowledge.**
