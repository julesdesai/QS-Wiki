## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence and the proposition is true, but their belief would remain the same if the proposition were false due to the evidence relying on misleading but consistent data. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A case in which someone believes a true proposition based on evidence, but the evidence is misleading and would result in the same belief if the proposition were false, is not a case in which the belief is sensitive.**
