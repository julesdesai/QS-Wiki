## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes that they have a twin sibling they have never met, which is true, but there is a true proposition that their sibling is involved in illegal activities they don't know about. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not know they have a twin, as the existence of the sibling's illegal activities serves as a defeater the person is unaware of.**, **If knowledge requires that there are no true propositions which would defeat justification if believed, then any such unknown true proposition makes knowledge impossible.**, **The requirement for the absence of defeaters implies an ideal state of awareness of all potentially relevant true propositions, which is implausible for finite beings.**
