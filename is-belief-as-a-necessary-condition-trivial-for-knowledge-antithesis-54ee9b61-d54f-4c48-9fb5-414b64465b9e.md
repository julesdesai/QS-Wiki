## Content

**There is a plausible principle that belief is a mental state distinct from knowledge. This principle, together with the view that belief is a necessary condition for knowledge, entails that belief could occur without knowledge, yet it might be unnecessary to predicate knowledge on belief.**, **Consider a scenario where someone perceives something correctly but does not form a belief. Intuitively, perception might be sufficient for knowledge without an explicit belief.**
