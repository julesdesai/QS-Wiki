## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a scientist discovers a phenomenon indirectly through complex, mediated processes, such as mathematical modeling, rather than direct observation. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the scientist still knows the phenomenon.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can exist with indirect as well as direct causal links. This principle suggests that indirect pathways can be entirely legitimate for establishing knowledge.**
