## Content

**Consider a hypothetical scientist who develops a complex yet isolated network of intercoherent beliefs regarding an unobservable phenomenon, completely detached from empirical reality. Intuitively, we would judge that the scientist lacks knowledge due to lack of genuine connection to reality.**, **An isolated system of beliefs that internally coheres but lacks foundational support from empirical data challenges the view that coherence with foundational beliefs suffices for knowledge.**
