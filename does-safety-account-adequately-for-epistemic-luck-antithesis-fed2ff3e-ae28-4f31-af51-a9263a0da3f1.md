## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone correctly identifies the winning lottery number based on a whim or irrelevant belief. Intuitively, despite the truth of their belief, we would not count it as knowledge due to the luck involved.**, **Knowledge that arises purely from luck contradicts the requirement that understanding should result from a reliable process.**, **If knowledge can be the product of sheer luck in some cases, then safety as a sole criterion struggles to exclude fortuitous accurate beliefs from knowledge.**
