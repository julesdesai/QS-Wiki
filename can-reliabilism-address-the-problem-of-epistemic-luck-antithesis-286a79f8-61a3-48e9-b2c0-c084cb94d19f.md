## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Jane, forms a belief that it is raining based on seeing wet grass. Intuitively, Jane should not be considered to know that it is raining because the grass was watered and not due to rain.**, **In such a scenario, the condition that the belief is formed by a reliable process might be met, as Jane normally would accurately infer rain from wet grass.**, **The reliability of the belief-forming process fails to capture the element of luck involved in Jane's belief being true, suggesting that reliability is not sufficient for knowledge.**
