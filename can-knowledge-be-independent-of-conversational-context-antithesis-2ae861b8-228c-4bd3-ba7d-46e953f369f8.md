## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people in different rooms are inquiring about the same fact, such as the time of day. In one room, the conversational standards for knowledge are high, while in the other they are low. Intuitively, it seems odd to say that one person knows the time while the other does not, merely due to conversational context differences.**, **If knowledge depends on conversational context, then a person's knowledge status about a proposition could change simply by walking from one room to another, even without any change in their belief or the truth of the proposition.**
