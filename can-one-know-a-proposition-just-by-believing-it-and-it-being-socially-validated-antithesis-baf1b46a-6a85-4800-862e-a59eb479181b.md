## Content

**Suppose a person believes in a proposition solely because it is the accepted norm within their culture, without independent verification. In this scenario, intuitively, one might judge that the person lacks knowledge since the belief is based solely on social norms, not on a critical assessment of truth.**, **It is implausible that mere social validation, without individual critical examination and verification, is sufficient for true knowledge. This suggests that an additional element beyond belief, truth, and social validation might be necessary for knowledge.**
