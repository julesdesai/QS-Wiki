## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person in a room with multiple indistinguishable buckets chooses the one bucket containing water due to their skills but only because they happen to have no genuine obstacles. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person's success in believing there is water is partially due to luck.**, **It is implausible that a true belief can be considered knowledge when it results from an accidental avoidance of obstacles.**
