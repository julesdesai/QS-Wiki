## Content

**Suppose empirical knowledge claims, such as ‘the apple is red’, depend on sensory experiences which provide finite justification. The reliance on direct sensory experience seems sufficient for us to declare knowledge intuitively. Infinitism suggests this is not enough, requiring infinite non-repeating reasons, thus implying empirical knowledge is rarely attainable, which seems incompatible with our understanding of learning through experience.**
