## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the truth condition for knowledge is fixed and independent of context. This principle, together with varying contextual justifications, reveals a potential conflict, as justification should align with fixed truth.**, **Consider a scenario where the context suggests differing sufficiency of evidence for the same truth, leading intuitively to conflicts in what is counted as knowledge.**
