## Content

**Certain belief-forming processes are inherently unreliable, such as those relying on superstition or hearsay.**, **If a belief formed through an unreliable process coheres with a person's other beliefs and is true, it raises doubts about the sufficiency of the coherence and truth criteria for knowledge.**, **The potential for belief systems based on unreliable processes to meet the criteria of coherentism challenges its effectiveness as a knowledge attribution theory.**
