**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is justified by coherence with other beliefs in a system**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the coherent belief system is anchored by a set of foundational or self-evident truths**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, the belief coheres within a consistent and comprehensive belief system, and is grounded by fundamental axioms**
