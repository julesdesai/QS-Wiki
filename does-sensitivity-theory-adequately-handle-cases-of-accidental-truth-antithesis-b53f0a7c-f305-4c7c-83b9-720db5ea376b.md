## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Jane, looks at a broken clock that happens to display the correct time by coincidence, and she believes it is noon based on that.**, **In this scenario, it is intuitively plausible to judge that Jane does not know it is noon, even though her belief is true.**, **According to sensitivity theory, Jane knows it is noon since she believes it, the belief would not be held if the proposition were false (as the clock could read a different time), and it is true that it is noon.**, **The sensitivity condition seems to fail to capture the knowledge status because the truth is accidental, not due to Jane's method of belief formation.**
