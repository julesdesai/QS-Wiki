## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a basic belief, which supports several intermediate justified beliefs, ultimately leading to the belief in a true proposition. Intuitively, if any intermediate belief is unjustified, we would not say the final belief amounts to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be justified and part of knowledge, all supporting beliefs must also be justified.**
