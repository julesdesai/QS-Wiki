## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a justified belief that turns out to be false.**, **If a justified false belief does not undermine the same person's other beliefs that are true, then the presence of a defeater for false belief casts doubt as a necessary condition for knowledge.**, **The issue is whether possessing some false justified beliefs inherently undermines the possibility of other knowledge.**
