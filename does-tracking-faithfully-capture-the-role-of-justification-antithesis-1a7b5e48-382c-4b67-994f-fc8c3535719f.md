## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a belief that tracks truth across every relevant possible world, though the explanations and justifications they hold for this belief are entirely incorrect. Intuitively, we may not want to consider this justified belief as true knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that for a belief to be knowledge, its justification must also have grounding in valid reasoning or evidence. This principle together with the sufficiency of tracking presents a conceptual difficulty.**
