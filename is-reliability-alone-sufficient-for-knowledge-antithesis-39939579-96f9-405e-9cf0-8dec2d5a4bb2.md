## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person P forms a true belief that it is raining because they read it on a consistently accurate weather app. Intuitively, if the app was hacked and displayed 'raining' regardless of weather, then even if true it causes concern about P's knowledge claim.**, **There is a plausible principle that even if belief formation is usually reliable, contingent or accidental truth of the belief undermines knowledge. If the belief's truth is accidental from app hacking, this threatens sufficient reliability.**
