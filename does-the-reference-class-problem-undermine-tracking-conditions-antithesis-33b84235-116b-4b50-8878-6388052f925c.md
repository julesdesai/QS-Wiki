## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the reference class from which beliefs are derived affects knowledge classification. This principle together with varying reference classes leading to different outcomes suggests inconsistency in tracking applicability.**, **Suppose a person belongs to multiple reference classes for a belief; changing the class alters whether the belief tracks the truth, raising questions about consistent applicability of tracking conditions.**
