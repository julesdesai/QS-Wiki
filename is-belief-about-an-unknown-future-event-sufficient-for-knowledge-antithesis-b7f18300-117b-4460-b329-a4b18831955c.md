## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person predicts a future event, like the outcome of a sports match, without basis but the prediction turns out correct and uninformed by any falsehood. Intuitively, such belief lacks the certainty required for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that beliefs about unknown future events, even if true and uninfluenced by falsehood, can constitute genuine knowledge.**
