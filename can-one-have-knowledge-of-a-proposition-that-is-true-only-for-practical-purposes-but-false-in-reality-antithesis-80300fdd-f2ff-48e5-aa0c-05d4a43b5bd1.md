## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes that a bridge is structurally sound based on outdated inspection data. For practical purposes, given this belief, they proceed to use the bridge. Later, it is revealed that the bridge was actually unsound at that time. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person did not know the bridge was safe.**, **A principle holds that practical truth must align with actual truth. This principle, together with the notion that a proposition need only be practically true for knowledge, suggests a disconnect when practical purposes diverge from reality.**
