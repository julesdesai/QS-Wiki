## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person Smith has a justified belief that the person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket because Smith was told by the boss that Jones will get the job, and Smith has counted the coins in Jones's pocket. Unbeknownst to Smith, Smith also has ten coins in their pocket and ends up getting the job. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Smith does not know the person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket despite having a justified true belief.**
