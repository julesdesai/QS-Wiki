## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes and justifies a true proposition in the actual world, but in nearby possible worlds, the conditions are significantly different, yet the belief happens to remain true. Intuitively, we might say the person lacks knowledge because the truth seems accidental.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be stable across similar conditions. If the belief's truth varies under slightly different conditions, it undermines the belief's qualification as knowledge.**
