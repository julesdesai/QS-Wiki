## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief using a reliable process, but the belief's truth is due to a lucky accident rather than the reliability of the process. Intuitively, we would judge that this lucky accident does not constitute genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not include elements of accidental truths. This principle, together with the fact that reliable processes can sometimes lead to accidental truths, implies that reliability is not sufficient for knowledge.**
