## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist's erroneous method accidentally leads them to a true scientific discovery. Intuitively, this accidental correct outcome is not seen as real knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must result from correct reasoning or methodology as opposed to accident.**, **It is implausible to regard accidental correctness as sufficient for knowledge when the process involved lacks rigor and reliability.**
