**Node ID:** 11fd3891-97ab-49eb-9469-0317d21aa7de
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Contextualist Coherentism](knowledge-as-contextualist-coherentism-synthesis-869f3936-996a-4b69-aa25-774772cf8d3d.md)

## Content

**Consider a scenario where two distinct contexts offer contradicting standards for the same proposition. Intuitively, this would lead to a paradox, complicating knowledge claims considerably.**, **Contextualism suggests seamless adaptability, but conflicting contexts highlight its limits, affecting claims of sufficient conditions.**
