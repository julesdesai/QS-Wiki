## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief is supported by seemingly strong justification, but common defeaters, such as misleading advertising, are not considered. Intuitively, ignoring these everyday defeaters weakens the claim to knowledge.**, **It is plausible that for justification to contribute to knowledge, it must account for common and accessible defeaters. This principle implies that overlooking such defeaters undermines the sufficiency of the justification for knowledge.**
