## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds onto a belief because of stubbornness or commitment, regardless of the evidence contrary to a proposition's truth. Intuitively, we would question their knowledge claim because the steadfastness is due to personal traits rather than a connection to truth.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should change in the face of true contrary evidence, suggesting that mere consistency of belief does not guarantee knowledge.**
