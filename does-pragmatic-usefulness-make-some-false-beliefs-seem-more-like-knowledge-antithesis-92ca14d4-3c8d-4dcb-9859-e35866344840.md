## Content

**Consider a situation where a false belief, like believing a placebo has healing properties, leads to positive outcomes continually reinforced by social and psychological factors. Intuitively, this false belief might be treated as knowledge due to its pragmatic success.**, **Pragmatic usefulness is considered non-essential in defining knowledge, yet there seems to be a tension, when a false belief consistently yields beneficial results, with treating it as outright false when it appears to serve knowledge-like functions in practice.**
