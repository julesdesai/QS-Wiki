## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person named Taylor occasionally exhibits intellectual virtues in a field where they are generally incorrect. Intuitively, we might judge that Taylor does not gain knowledge in the isolated instances where virtues manifest, since beliefs are generally unreliable.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires generally reliable methods of belief-formation. This principle suggests that isolated instances of virtue amidst unreliable beliefs do not suffice for knowledge.**
