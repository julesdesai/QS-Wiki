## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person P forms a belief that it will rain tomorrow because they always assume it will rain and by chance it does rain. Intuitively, we would say P does not know it will rain, even though the belief was true and not reliant on luck in reasoning.**, **In such a scenario, it seems the truth of the belief is not due to intellectual virtue or competence, suggesting a problem with the view that such components suffice for knowledge.**
