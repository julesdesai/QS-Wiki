## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a network of beliefs, each supporting the others, yet all based on a fundamental falsehood, while one belief happens to be true by coincidence. Intuitively, it seems incorrect to say this person knows the true belief.**, **It is implausible that a person can have knowledge of a true belief that is supported by a coherent system if the coherence itself is rooted in falsehoods.**
