## Content

**Suppose we have a case where foundational beliefs are not actually reliable guides to truth, such as those stemming from faulty sensory perceptions or entrenched cultural biases, yet are nonetheless treated as foundational. Intuitively, we either have to say that knowledge exists due to contextual acceptance or that it does not due to factual unreliability. If we say knowledge exists, then foundational status is problematically disconnected from truth. If we say it does not, then epistemic context becomes sometimes insufficient, missing the mark of sufficiency for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should reliably indicate truth. This principle together with foundational status from unreliable sources entails that merely being derived from foundational beliefs might be insufficient for true knowledge.**
