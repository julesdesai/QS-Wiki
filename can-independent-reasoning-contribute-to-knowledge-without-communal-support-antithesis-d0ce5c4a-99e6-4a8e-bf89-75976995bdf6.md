## Content

**Consider a case where an individual uses independent reasoning to arrive at a true belief without any support from communal epistemic practices. Intuitively, we might say the individual knows the proposition by virtue of their reasoning.**, **There is a plausible principle that independent reasoning, if rigorous and truth-conducive, can justify a belief to the status of knowledge without communal input.**
