## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through a reliable process, but there is an unusual causal chain linking the process to the truth of the belief, such that the causal chain is not typical of competent belief formation. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A case in which a belief is formed through a causal chain that is not typical of virtuous intellectual processes challenges the notion that it arises from intellectual virtue or competence.**, **A belief formed through a deviant causal chain might still be true and track the truth counterfactually in certain scenarios, yet it does not seem to amount to knowledge.**
