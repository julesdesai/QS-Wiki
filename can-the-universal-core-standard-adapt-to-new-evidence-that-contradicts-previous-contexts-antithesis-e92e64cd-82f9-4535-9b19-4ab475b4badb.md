## Content

**Consider a scientific community that rejects a previously universal core justification standard due to new overwhelming evidence. Intuitively, their knowledge shifts despite the previous core, suggesting that adaptation is essential and previously sufficient core standards can fail.**, **It is implausible that a fixed universal core can withstand continual shifts in empirical evidence without recognizing these shifts.**
