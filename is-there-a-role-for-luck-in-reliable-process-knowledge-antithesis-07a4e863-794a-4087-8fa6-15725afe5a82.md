## Content

**A person forms a belief through a reliable process and coincidentally, due to sheer luck, the belief turns out true when it could have easily been false due to external factors. Intuitively, we would question whether this constitutes knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be dependent on factors like luck. This principle implies that even beliefs obtained through reliable processes may not always count as knowledge if luck plays a significant role.**
