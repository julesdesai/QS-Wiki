**Consider a case where a person's belief is justified and turns out to be true, but it's formed through a truth-tracking process that is uncommon or atypical. Intuitively, most would still say the person has knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not only be about forming true beliefs but also about justification that matches typical truth-tracking processes.**
