## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a scientific theory is widely believed and taken to be true because it is justified appropriately in a specific academic context, yet lacks unanimous evidence across contexts and disciplines. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the theoryâ€™s status as knowledge is conditional rather than universally valid, raising questions about knowledge robustness.**, **There is a plausible principle that universally true propositions should not rely on variable justification standards, as knowledge should reflect universal truths rather than context-dependent agreements.**
