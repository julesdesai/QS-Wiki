## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief is safe, then it should remain true across all nearby possible worlds. This principle together with the scenario where a person, Alice, believes a coin will land heads because it is weighted, yet the only nearby worlds where this belief might be tested include some where external factors could disturb it, illustrates a tension. Alice thus cannot know the coin will land heads, even if it often does, because it isn't true in all possible worlds.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires absolute infallibility across nearby possible worlds, as knowledge should allow for reasonable exceptions.**
