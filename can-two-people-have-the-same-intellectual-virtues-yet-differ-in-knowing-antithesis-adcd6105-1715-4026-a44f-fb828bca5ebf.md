## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two scientists form beliefs about a chemical reaction, using the same rigorous methodologies. One scientist happens to guess the right conditions by chance and forms a true belief, while the other makes a slight error with false results. Intuitively, not both outcomes are knowledge.**
**A case in which beliefs are formed through identical intellectual virtues but result in different truth values challenges the assumption that virtue guarantees consistent knowledge outcomes.**
**A plausible principle is that outcomes dependent on luck or chance suggest intellectual virtue alone does not guarantee knowledge, pinpointing the necessity of other stabilizing factors.**
