## Content

**A scenario involves Jordan choosing a lottery ticket by random selection and believing it will lose based on the astronomical odds. The ticket in fact loses, but were the odds slightly different or if the lottery were not conducted fairly, Jordan would still not believe in losing purely break due to original baseline chance belief. Intuitively, Jordan doesn't know the lottery result because his belief hinges only on luck rather than an informed expectation.**, **Without sensitivity challenging casual reliance on highly probable misopportunities as in Jordan's case, true knowledge might have less to do with epistemic validation and more by mere chance**
