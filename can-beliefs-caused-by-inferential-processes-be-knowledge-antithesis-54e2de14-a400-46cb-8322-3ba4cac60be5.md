## Content

**Suppose a person deduces that it is raining by seeing people with wet umbrellas entering a building.**, **The deduced belief that it is raining is caused by the sight of wet umbrellas, not directly by the rain itself.**, **Intuitively, this inferential belief could still constitute knowledge, suggesting that direct causation by the fact is not needed.**
