## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is true and justified by strong empirical evidence alone, such as a scientist relying on experimental data to confirm a hypothesis. Intuitively, we either have to say that the scientist has knowledge or not. If we say the scientist does not have knowledge due to lack of multiple justifications, then this seems to deny many instances of scientific knowledge.**
