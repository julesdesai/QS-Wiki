## Content

**Consider abstract knowledge such as mathematical truths. Such truths do not lend themselves to straightforward causal interactions. Intuitively, this kind of knowledge seems unaffected by a lack of causal connection.**, **It is implausible that causal connections are necessary for all types of knowledge, specifically abstract and necessary truths that are known through reason alone.**
