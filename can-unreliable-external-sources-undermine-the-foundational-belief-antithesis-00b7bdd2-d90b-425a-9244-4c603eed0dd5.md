## Content

**Suppose a belief is derived from an external source like the news, which is generally reliable but occasionally erroneous.**, **If the belief turns out to be true but was based on a source that was unreliable in a particular instance, it challenges whether the belief was genuinely known.**, **The potential unreliability of external sources raises a question about their sufficiency to underpin foundational beliefs in a way that constitutes knowledge.**
