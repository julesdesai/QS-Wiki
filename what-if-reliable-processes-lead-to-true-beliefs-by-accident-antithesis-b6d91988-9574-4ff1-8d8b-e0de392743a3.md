## Content

**Consider a situation where a person guesses the correct answer to a complex trivia question by selecting the option that sounds most pleasing. Here, the belief formation process of choosing based on aesthetic soundness is not independently reliable for truth about trivia facts. Intuitively, even should the guess be true, we would not say the guesser knew the trivia answer.**
