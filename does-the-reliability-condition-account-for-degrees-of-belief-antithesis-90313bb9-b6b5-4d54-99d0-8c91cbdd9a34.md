## Content

**Consider cases where beliefs may have varying degrees of confidence rather than binary states of belief.**, **Reliabilism tends to treat belief as a simple binary state concerning its truth.**, **This inadequately captures more complex circumstances where the degree of confidence affects whether a belief is likely to be accurate or true.**
