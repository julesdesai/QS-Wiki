## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition based primarily on subjective justification, such as intuition. Intuitively, reliance on subjective justification appears insufficient for securing knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that objective justification is essential for knowledge. This principle together with reliance on subjective justification entails potential insufficiency in claiming knowledge.**
