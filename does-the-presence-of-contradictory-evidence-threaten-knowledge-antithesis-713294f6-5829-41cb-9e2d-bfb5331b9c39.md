## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a true belief based on correct reasoning but is also aware of credible but false evidence contradicting this belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that the knowledge is overridden by the awareness of credible counter-evidence or that contradictory evidence has no impact on knowledge. If we say the former about this case, then false lemmas theory may not capture this aspect of knowledge.**, **Intuitively, the co-existence of aware contradictory evidence with a true belief can impede the qualification of such a belief as knowledge.**
