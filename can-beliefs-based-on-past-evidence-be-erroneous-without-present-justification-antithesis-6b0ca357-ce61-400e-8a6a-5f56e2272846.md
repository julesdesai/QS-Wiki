## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person is emotionally attached to a belief and it influences their memory of the evidence that originally justified the belief. Over time, their recollection of the evidence becomes distorted. Intuitively, such distorted memories make the continued belief seem less like knowledge and more like wishful thinking.**, **Knowledge intuitively requires accurate recall or present justification of past evidence. If memory itself becomes unreliable and the person lacks present justification, the belief appears not to meet the criteria for knowledge anymore.**
