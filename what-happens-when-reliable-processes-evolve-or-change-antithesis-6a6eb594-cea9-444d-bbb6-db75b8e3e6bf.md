## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person relies on a cognitive process that was once reliable but is now outdated or irrelevant due to new evidence or circumstances. Intuitively, we would judge that the process may no longer yield knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must adapt with new evidence to remain valid. This principle together with the case suggests that a process must be currently reliable, not just historically reliable, for it to contribute to knowledge.**
