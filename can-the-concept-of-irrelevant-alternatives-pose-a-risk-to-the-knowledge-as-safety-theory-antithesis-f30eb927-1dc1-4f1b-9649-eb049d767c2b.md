## Content

**Suppose a person identifies an animal at a zoo as a zebra and believes it to be true. In most nearby possible worlds, other indistinguishable options like a cleverly-disguised mule are present, causing the belief to be false. However, intuitively, the unstated possibility of such alternatives does not seem to affect their knowledge in the current world.**, **In this scenario, while the personâ€™s belief is true and they consider it knowledge, omnipresent but irrelevant alternatives could make this belief false in most nearby possible worlds, hinting at misaligned knowledge claims if relying on the criterion of safety.**
