## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person accidentally forms a belief based on a faulty inference that coincidentally leads to truth. Intuitively, this doesn't seem to constitute knowledge despite involving justified true belief.**, **The existence of beliefs formed through error that still happen to be true challenges the sufficiency of belief, truth, and self-evident justification for knowledge.**
