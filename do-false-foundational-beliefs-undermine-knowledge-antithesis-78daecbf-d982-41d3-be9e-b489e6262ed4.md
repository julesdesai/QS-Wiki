## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's foundational belief is actually false, such as belief in scientific theories later refuted, but this belief is foundational due to widespread acceptance and incorporation into further beliefs. Intuitively, we might have to say that foundational beliefs can lead to false beliefs being transmitted as knowledge, or alternatively, deny they ever constituted knowledge, leading to skepticism about epistemic context providing knowledge.**, **A logically consistent model of knowledge should not permit foundational yet false beliefs to be regarded as components of knowledge. This together with accepted false beliefs being foundational entails a disjunction where foundationalism must be either restricted or adjusted to avoid accommodating falsehoods.**
