## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person is isolated from social interactions but holds true beliefs about the world, such as a scientist working alone who believes in certain scientific truths without any external validation. Intuitively, we would say this person has knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not depend solely on conversational contexts for its validation, as individuals can have knowledge even in the absence of such contexts.**
