**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs that includes all logical consequences of the propositions**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the system of beliefs incorporates objective criteria to constrain variability**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs that includes all logical consequences of the propositions along with objective constraints**
