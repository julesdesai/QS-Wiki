## Content

**Suppose in a particular context, persons have unequal access to information relevant to a knowledge claim. Intuitively, this can lead to differing abilities to meet the supposed contextual standards of knowledge.**, **If knowledge standards depend on context, and context differs among individuals due to information asymmetries, then the contextual account may struggle to provide a consistent measure for knowledge.**
