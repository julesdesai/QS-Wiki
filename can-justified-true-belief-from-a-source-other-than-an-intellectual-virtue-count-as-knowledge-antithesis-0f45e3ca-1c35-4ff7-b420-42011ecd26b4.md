## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief that is true and justified through the process of a reliable cognitive mechanism that is not necessarily an intellectual virtue, such as a lucky guess. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the proposition.**, **Suppose a reliable cognitive process, such as a computer generating reports, produces a true and justified belief in a person. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the proposition, although the belief did not arise from an intellectual virtue.**
