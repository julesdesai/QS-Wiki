## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based solely on coherent empirical observations within a mistaken context. Intuitively, we would not judge that the person has knowledge.**, **Suppose a person forms a belief based on strong empirical evidence and coherent systems, but the external world contradicts the underlying facts. Intuitively, this results in a lack of true knowledge.**
