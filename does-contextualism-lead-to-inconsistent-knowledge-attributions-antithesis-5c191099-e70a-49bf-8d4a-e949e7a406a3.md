## Content

**Suppose a person claims to know a certain fact in a casual conversation, aligning with the context-specific standard. In a different, more scrutinized context, if the same person no longer meets the heightened standard, intuitively it seems inconsistent that knowledge could be both possessed and not possessed.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can both be had and not had about the same proposition merely by changing the context of evaluation.**
