## Content

**Complex human reasoning often involves unreliable processes that collectively yield reliable results. Intuitively, this aggregation of weak reliability challenges the simplicity of individual reliable processes as knowledge guarantees.**, **There is a plausible principle that emphasizes the reliability of the entire cognitive system over individual processes in complex reasoning tasks.**
