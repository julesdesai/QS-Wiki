## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief about a proposition based on a process that is generally reliable but, in this instance, delivers a true belief purely by chance. Intuitively, we might judge that this is not a case of knowledge.**, **If a true belief is formed based on a freak coincidence, even when a reliable process was employed, this challenges the sufficiency of the reliable process requirement for knowledge.**
