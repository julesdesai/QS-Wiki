## Content

**Suppose a detective believes a suspect committed a crime, a proposition that is true, but initially lacks concrete evidence. Intuitively, as more evidence emerges, her belief solidifies into knowledge.**, **Learning new evidence or counterevidence can dramatically shift the safety condition of a belief.**, **If the acquisition of new evidence can retroactively transform belief into knowledge, then initial knowledge claims become problematic.**
