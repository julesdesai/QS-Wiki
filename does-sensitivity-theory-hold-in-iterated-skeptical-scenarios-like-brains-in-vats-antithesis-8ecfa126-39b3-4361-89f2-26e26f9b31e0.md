## Content

**Suppose a person, Alice, considers a skeptical hypothesis where she is a brain in a vat, believing her reality is as perceived, yet she is not a brain in a vat.**, **Intuitively, Alice would not know she is not a brain in a vat because the skeptical scenario undermines her ability to distinguish reality.**, **Sensitivity theory suggests Alice knows she is not a brain in a vat because her belief matches reality and she would not hold the belief if the proposition were false.**, **The difficulty is that Alice cannot meaningfully test her belief against reality under the inference of the sensitivity criterion, casting doubt on knowing due to the lack of distinguishing capability.**
