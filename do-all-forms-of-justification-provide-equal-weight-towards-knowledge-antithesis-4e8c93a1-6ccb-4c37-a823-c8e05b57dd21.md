## Content

**Consider a situation where a person relies solely on a horoscope for making a decision, and accidentally the information is accurate, resulting in a true belief with justification. In this case, intuitively, the reliance on a horoscope does not seem sufficient for claiming knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that some forms of justification, especially those that are unreliable or arbitrary, might not contribute adequately toward knowledge even if the belief turns out to be true.**
