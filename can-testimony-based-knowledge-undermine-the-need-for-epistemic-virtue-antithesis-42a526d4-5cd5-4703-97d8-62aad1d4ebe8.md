## Content

**Suppose a person acquires a true belief by accepting a testimony of a credible expert without understanding the proposition itself. Intuitively, it seems the person has knowledge because the belief is true and trusted, though it did not result from the exercise of epistemic virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that testimony can yield knowledge when the belief is true and the source is reliable, challenging the requirement that epistemic virtue must be personally exercised for knowledge.**
