## Content

**Consider the case in which a person's belief system appears coherent and strong but is actually structured around self-deceptive beliefs. Intuitively, self-deception seems to undermine the authenticity of coherence as a basis for justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that genuine knowledge must be free from self-deception. This principle together with the possibility of self-deceptive systems posing as coherent systems entails that coherence is insufficient for true justification without additional safeguards against self-deception.**
