## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person believes a proposition, and their belief is true with seemingly no defeaters present. Then new evidence surfaces presenting a defeater that was previously unknown. Intuition suggests the person did not possess knowledge even when the defeater was unknown.**, **This implies that the identification of all potential defeaters is not always feasible, challenging the sufficiency of the no-defeaters condition for knowledge.**
