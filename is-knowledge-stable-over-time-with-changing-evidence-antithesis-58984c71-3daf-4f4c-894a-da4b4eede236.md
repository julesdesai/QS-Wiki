## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a true proposition with justification but additional evidence emerges that undercuts the justification. Intuitively, their knowledge status seems undermined.**, **It is plausible to suggest that knowing a proposition should not be so easily affected by subsequent evidence, which challenges the stability of knowledge as defeasible justified true belief.**
