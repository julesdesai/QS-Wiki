## Content

**A situation exists where Maria knows a plane will arrive on time, given no delays. In most nearby worlds, weather affects arrivals, yet exceptionally, this flight isnâ€™t affected. Intuitively, Maria knows the arrival time under normal conditions, not extraordinary ones.**, **To rely on nearby possible worlds as a measure for safety could misrepresent applicable conditions for knowledge, as real-world variability isn't just spatially but contextually broad.**
