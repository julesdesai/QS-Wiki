## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a political slogan because it is constantly reinforced by media, not because they have evaluated its truth. The belief remains stable across similar situations. Intuitively, we either have to say the belief is knowledge or suspect its foundation. If we say it is knowledge, it implies mere external coherence without justification is sufficient. If we say it is suspect, then external influences can prevent true knowledge.**
