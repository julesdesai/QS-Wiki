## Content

**A case in which a person P believes a proposition Q, Q is true, and no subjective defeaters appear in P's assessment, yet an objective observer sees an undermining condition.**, **Intuitively, if an objective standard for defeaters is unmet, P lacks knowledge regardless of P's subjective assessment.**, **This points to the need for grounding defeasibility outside of individual perspective, suggesting external justification's importance.**
