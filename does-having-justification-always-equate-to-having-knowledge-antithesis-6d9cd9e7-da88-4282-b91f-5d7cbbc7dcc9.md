## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone has a justified belief based on evidence that an innocent person is a criminal due to mistaken identity by all witnesses. Intuitively, we would judge that their justification does not equate to knowledge as the belief is false.**, **Having justification does not guarantee that the belief will be true; hence, it is insufficient for knowledge.**
