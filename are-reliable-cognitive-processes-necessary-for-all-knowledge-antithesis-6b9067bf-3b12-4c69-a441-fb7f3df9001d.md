## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based purely on a gut feeling or instinct.**, **Intuitively, we might say that the person knows the proposition even if the belief was not formed through an identifiable reliable cognitive process.**, **This suggests that belief formation involving reliable cognitive processes may not be necessary for all instances of knowledge.**
