## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a belief that is true and stems from intellectual virtue, but the person's intellectual virtue is unstable, being present one day and absent the next. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say they have knowledge due to the lack of a stable foundation.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a stable basis, suggesting instability in intellectual virtue could undermine the sufficiency of such a virtue for knowledge.**
