## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief's justification is circular, such as believing 'it will rain because the weather report says so, and the weather report is reliable because it often rains when predicted'. Intuitively, circularity undermines genuine justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that good justifications must avoid circular reasoning. Coherentism appears to permit circular chains, which questions its sufficiency for knowledge.**
