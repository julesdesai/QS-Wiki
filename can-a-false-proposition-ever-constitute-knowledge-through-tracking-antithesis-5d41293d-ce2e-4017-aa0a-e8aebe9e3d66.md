## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a false proposition, but through a series of fortunate events or coincidences, their belief leads them consistently to correct, true beliefs in related propositions across nearby possible worlds. Intuitively, we might say that their belief is tracking what is true.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth is a necessary condition for knowledge. This principle together with the idea that tracking can sometimes lead to true outcomes from a false basis creates a tension that challenges the theory.**
