## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person named Alex automatically responds to questions correctly due to a deep intuitive sense but does not actively believe these responses. In such a scenario, we intuitively judge that Alex possesses knowledge despite the lack of belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that one can possess knowledge even if one does not consciously hold a belief in the proposition. This principle, together with the case of Alex, challenges the notion that belief is necessary for knowledge.**
