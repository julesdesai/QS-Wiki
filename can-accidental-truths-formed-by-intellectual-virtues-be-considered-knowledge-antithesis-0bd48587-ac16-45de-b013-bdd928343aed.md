**Consider a case where a person uses careful reasoning to conclude that a specific horse will win a race.**, **The person concludes this based on sound analysis and past data, but the horse wins purely by chance due to other competitors being disqualified.**, **Intuitively, although the belief was true and formed by an intellectual virtue, it does not seem to be genuine knowledge due to the accidental nature of the outcome.**
