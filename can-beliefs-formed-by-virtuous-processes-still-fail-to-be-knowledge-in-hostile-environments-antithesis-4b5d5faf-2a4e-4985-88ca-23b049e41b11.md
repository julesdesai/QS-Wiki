## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition through an intellectually virtuous process, but the environment is hostile to reliable belief formation, such as being surrounded by deceptive evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be held when the surrounding environment introduces a high likelihood of error despite the individual process being reliable.**
