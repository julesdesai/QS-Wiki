## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a false proposition, but this belief coheres with their comprehensive system of beliefs due to misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to qualify as knowledge, the belief must not only be coherent but also correspond to an actual state of affairs in the world. This principle, together with the scenario, entails that coherence alone cannot guarantee knowledge.**
