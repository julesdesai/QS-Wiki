## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person adheres to intellectual openness, leading to changing beliefs about a debated issue like diet trends, while another holds fast due to intellectual courage to resist fads, resulting in consistent beliefs. Intuitively, neither consistent belief clearly surpasses the other in terms of knowledge.**
**A case where different intellectual virtues, like openness and courage, lead to opposing beliefs on the same issue raises questions about which resulting belief is true or represents knowledge.**
**It is plausible that the influence of certain intellectual virtues on belief requires a harmonization that is not inherently given, complicating simple assumptions about how virtue leads to knowledge.**
