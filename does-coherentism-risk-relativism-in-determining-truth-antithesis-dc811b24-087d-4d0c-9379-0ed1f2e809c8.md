## Content

**Different individuals or cultures can have different coherent systems that contradict one another.**, **Without an external truth measure, coherence allows for multiple incompatible yet valid knowledge claims.**, **If coherence alone suffices for knowledge, then opposing but internally consistent beliefs could both represent knowledge.**, **The absence of a universal truth standard in coherentism leads to relativism, weakening claims to objective knowledge.**
