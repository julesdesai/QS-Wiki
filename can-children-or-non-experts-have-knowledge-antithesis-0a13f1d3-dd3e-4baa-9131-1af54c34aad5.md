## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a child forms a true belief, such as knowing it is raining by looking out the window, but lacks developed intellectual virtues. Intuitively, we would judge that the child knows it is raining despite not possessing full intellectual virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be limited to those with fully developed intellectual virtues. This principle together with the scenario suggests that intellectual virtue is not a necessary condition for knowledge.**
