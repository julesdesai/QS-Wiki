## Content

**Suppose a person has formed beliefs using scientific theories that were considered reliable in the past but are now outdated. Intuitively, beliefs formed based on outdated information do not qualify as knowledge, demonstrating a flaw in assuming static reliability over time.**, **A principle is that cognitive processes must remain reliable in contemporary contexts to yield knowledge, not just historically or previously.**
