## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a deeply justified belief based on good evidence, yet in a hypothetical scenario, they might abandon this belief if given misleading information. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know despite giving up the belief in some scenarios, or they don't know. If we say they don't know, it seemingly dismisses justified beliefs.**
