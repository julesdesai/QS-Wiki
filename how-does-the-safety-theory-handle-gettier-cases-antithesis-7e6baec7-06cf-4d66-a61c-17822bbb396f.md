## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a justified true belief due to misleading evidence (like faulty but fortunately accurate testimony). Intuitively, people would say this isn't knowledge because the belief was correct only by chance.**, **In such scenarios, though the belief is true and justified, the safety condition may not prevent the classification as knowledge given that the truth depends on luck.**
