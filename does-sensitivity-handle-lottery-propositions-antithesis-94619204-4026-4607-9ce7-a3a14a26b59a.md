## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone holds a ticket in a large fair lottery and believes it will lose, a belief that turns out true. Intuitively, we would not say that the person knows the ticket will lose.**, **In this case, even if the proposition "this ticket will lose" is true and the person would not believe it if it were false, intuitively, we typically do not attribute knowledge to merely probabilistic reasoning.**
