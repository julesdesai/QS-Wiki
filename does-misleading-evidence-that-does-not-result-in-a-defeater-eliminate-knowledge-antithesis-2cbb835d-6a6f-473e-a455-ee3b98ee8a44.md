## Content

**In a scenario where a person believes a true proposition and no defeaters are present, but misleading evidence is available that could have inserted doubt, intuitively, the presence of such evidence suggests the belief is not knowledge, even if it never defeated the belief.**, **Knowledge plausibly requires the absence of not just actual, but also potential misleading evidence that might relate to the defeasibility of belief.**
