## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief through a reliable process, like correctly predicting a coin toss based on prior tosses, but their belief is also heavily influenced by luck since each toss is independent. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the element of luck involved in forming the belief undermines it being considered knowledge, even if the process is reliable.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should not depend on luck in such a way that makes the truth of the belief merely accidental. This principle suggests that reliability alone might not suffice for knowledge if luck plays a significant role in achieving true belief.**
