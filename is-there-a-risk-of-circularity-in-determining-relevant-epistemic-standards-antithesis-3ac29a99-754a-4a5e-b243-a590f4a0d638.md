## Content

**There is a plausible principle that epistemic standards applicable within a context should be determined independently of any specific knowledge claims.**, **Consider a scenario where the determination of appropriate epistemic standards for identifying knowledge within a context is influenced by the knowledge claims themselves. This raises issues of circular reasoning which intuitively undermines the justification process.**
