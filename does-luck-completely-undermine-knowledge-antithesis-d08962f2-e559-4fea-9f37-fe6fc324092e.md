## Content

**Consider a scenario where Maria believes a proposition through sheer guesswork and later finds independent verification by reliable means, confirming her initial belief. In such a scenario, intuitively, it seems we could judge that Maria knows the proposition post-verification despite the initial luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that subsequent confirmation can convert a lucky belief into knowledge. This principle challenges the notion that luck at any stage completely undermines knowledge.**
