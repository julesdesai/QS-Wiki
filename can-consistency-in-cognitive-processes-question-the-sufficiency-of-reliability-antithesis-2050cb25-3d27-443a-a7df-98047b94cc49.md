## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person consistently uses a flawed cognitive process that generally offers true beliefs due to unusual circumstances. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge despite the process being reliable in those instances.**, **The principle that reliability suffices for knowledge is challenged if consistency in use doesn't lead to consistent truth across normal circumstances.**
