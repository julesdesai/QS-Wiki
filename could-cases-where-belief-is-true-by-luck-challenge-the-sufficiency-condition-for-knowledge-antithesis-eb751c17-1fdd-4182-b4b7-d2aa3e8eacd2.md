## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a watch stops at 3 pm, but it is unknowingly picked up every day precisely at 3 pm by different individuals, who correctly infer the time. Intuitively, we must choose to say that these individuals know the time or that they do not because their correctness is coincidentally repeated every day.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a belief is correct solely by chance, it does not constitute knowledge even if repeatedly accurate in conjunction with truth and belief.**, **This challenges the sufficiency condition of true belief absent luck for knowledge, as repeat coincidence still undermines the reliable acquisition of knowledge.**
