## Content

**Consider a case where two entirely coherent but mutually contradictory systems exist, for instance, one based on scientific reasoning and one on superstition. In such a case, intuitively we must recognize that only one system can yield genuine knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that contradictory belief systems cannot simultaneously yield knowledge. This principle together with mutual coherence entails that coherence is insufficient for choosing between such systems.**
