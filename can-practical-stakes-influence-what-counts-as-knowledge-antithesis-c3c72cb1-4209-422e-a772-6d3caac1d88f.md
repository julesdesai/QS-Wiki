## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person must decide quickly on limited information with critical consequences, contrasted with a low-stakes decision, and they rely on justified true beliefs in both cases. Intuitively, the high-stakes scenario might require a higher justification standard for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that high and low-stakes situations demand the same level of justification for knowledge due to the practical importance, even when both meet the fixed standard.**
