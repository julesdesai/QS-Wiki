## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person P forms a true belief that a lottery ticket will lose based on a reasonable statistical understanding. However, P's belief is true merely by chance, as P does not have specific information about that ticket. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that P does not know the ticket will lose.**, **The condition that a belief arises from intellectual virtue or skill implies that the person's cognitive ability is the primary reason for the true belief. The belief being true due to luck, rather than skill, challenges the sufficiency of intellectual virtue or skill.**
