## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses a highly reliable medical test that incorrectly indicates the presence of a disease due to statistical error. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief in the test result is not knowledge, or that knowledge can include false conclusions. If we say the belief is knowledge, then knowledge can be false. If we say it is not, then reliability alone does not suffice for knowledge.**
