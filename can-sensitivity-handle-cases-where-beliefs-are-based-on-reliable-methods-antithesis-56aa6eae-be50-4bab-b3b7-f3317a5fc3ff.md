## Content

**Suppose a person uses a highly reliable method to form a belief that remains true, even in hypothetical scenarios where the false proposition is considered. Intuitively, we consider this as knowledge despite a lack of sensitivity.**, **It is implausible that sensitivity can account for all cases where reliable methods lead to true beliefs.**
