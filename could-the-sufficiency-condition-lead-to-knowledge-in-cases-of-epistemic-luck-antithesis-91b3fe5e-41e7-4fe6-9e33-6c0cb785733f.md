## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition solely because of an uncanny coincidence and their belief just happens to track the truth. Intuitively, we have to say that the person does not know the proposition if knowledge excludes mere epistemic luck. This questions whether the sufficiency condition can genuinely rule out luck.**
