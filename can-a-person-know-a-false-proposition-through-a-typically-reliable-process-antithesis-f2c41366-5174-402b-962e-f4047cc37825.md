## Content

**Consider a scenario where a typically reliable cognitive process results in the belief in a false proposition due to specific misleading circumstances. Intuitively, such a situation highlights that reliability alone may not rule out false beliefs from being considered knowledge.**, **For a belief to be false conflicts with the necessity of truth in knowledge, indicating that reliability likely needs supplemental criteria to properly designate knowledge.**
