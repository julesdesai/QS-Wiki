## Content

**Consider a case where a person acquires a belief from a credible testimony, without engaging in probabilistic reasoning about the testimonyâ€™s reliability. Intuitively, they seem to possess knowledge through testimony.**, **It is implausible to claim that all testimonial knowledge requires individual probabilistic reasoning, since people often trust reliable sources without engaging in such reasoning explicitly.**
