## Content

**Suppose an author writes a comprehensive book and justifiably believes each fact presented in it. In the preface, the author acknowledges the possibility of mistakes being present, expressing a belief that not all facts in the book are correct. Despite the justified true belief about each individual fact, the author's acknowledgment of potential errors suggests that they do not fully possess knowledge of the bookâ€™s complete correctness, presenting an issue for knowledge as justified true belief.**
