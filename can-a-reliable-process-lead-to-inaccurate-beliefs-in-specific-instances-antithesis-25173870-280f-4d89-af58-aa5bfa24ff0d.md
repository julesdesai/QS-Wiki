## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, relying on a usually reliable weather app, believes it will not rain today, but it unexpectedly does rain due to an unforeseeable weather anomaly. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the weather forecast despite using a reliable process.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person believes that a specific sports team will win based on a statistical model that has historically been accurate. If the team unexpectedly loses, intuitively we must say that the belief was not knowledge, even though it came from a reliable process.**
