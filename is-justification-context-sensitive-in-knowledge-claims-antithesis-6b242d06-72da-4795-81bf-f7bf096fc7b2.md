## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist claims to know a specific hypothesis is true when talking to colleagues but not when talking to a layperson. In such a scenario, intuitively we might find it unsettling that the truth of the statement could seemingly depend on the audience.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be consistent regardless of social context. This principle, together with the idea of context-dependent justification, suggests knowledge could be inherently variable, which is counterintuitive.**
