## Content

**Consider a case in which a person's belief tracks the truth across possible worlds by random chance rather than due to a reliable method or mechanism. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have genuine knowledge, despite satisfying the tracking condition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be based on a reliable method or process, not merely accidental conformity to truth-tracking conditions.**
