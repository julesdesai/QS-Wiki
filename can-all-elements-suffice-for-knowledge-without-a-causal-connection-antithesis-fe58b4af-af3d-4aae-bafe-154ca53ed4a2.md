## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition due to justified reasons, the proposition is true, but the belief does not have a causal connection to the truth, such as a blind chart analysis leading to a stock price prediction. Intuitively, we would feel that this lacks the robustness of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that even if someoneâ€™s belief is true and justified, without causal linkage to the truth, it may still fail to constitute knowledge, especially in purely predictive cases.**
