## Content

**There is a plausible principle that genuine knowledge should avoid circular reasoning. Coherentism might allow individual beliefs to justify each other in a circular way, without introducing new evidence.**, **Consider a scenario in which a series of interconnected beliefs justify each other without external justification. Intuitively, this web of beliefs spins in a circle and might not constitute true knowledge.**
