## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone believes a mathematical theorem is false despite it being a necessary truth. The intuition is that belief in some necessary falsehoods can be wrong without violating sensitivity.**, **A plausible principle is that sensitivity requires that if a proposition p is false, a person would not believe p. Combining this with belief in necessary falsehoods leads to a contradiction, as necessary falsehoods are false in all possible worlds.**, **Suppose a person incorrectly believes that a false necessary proposition is true. Intuitively, this belief cannot satisfy the sensitivity requirement since there aren't any possible worlds where the belief is false and the proposition true.**
