## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person unconsciously processes information leading to correct actions without forming explicit beliefs, like catching a falling object without consciously recognizing it's falling. Intuitively, the person's knowledge of what to do seems real despite the absence of explicit belief.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting that knowledge can manifest through implicit understanding or skill, without belief. This principle raises questions about the necessity of belief for knowledge.**
