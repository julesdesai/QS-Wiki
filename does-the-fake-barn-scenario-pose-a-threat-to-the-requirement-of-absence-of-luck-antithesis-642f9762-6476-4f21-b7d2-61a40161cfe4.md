## Content

**A person P is driving through a town filled with fake barns and by chance points to the only real barn and claims it's a barn. Although P's belief is true, it seems P doesn't have knowledge since the truth was accidentally rather than competently arrived at.**, **The fake-barn example questions if meeting the no-luck and competence conditions are indeed sufficient for knowledge since P's belief was vulnerable to the deceptive environment, highlighting a lingering element of luck.**
