## Content

**Suppose an individual believes a fact solely because it aligns with other beliefs, without evidence. Intuitively we would judge that this belief lacks justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification requires not only coherence but also evidential support. This principle implies that coherence alone might not justify knowledge.**
