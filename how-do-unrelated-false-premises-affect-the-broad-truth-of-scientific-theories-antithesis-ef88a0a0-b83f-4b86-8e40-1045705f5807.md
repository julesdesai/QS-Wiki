## Content

**Consider the scenario where a working scientific theory is accurate through extensive testing but was originally derived using one false unrelated premise in the historical development of the theory. Intuitively, science still possesses the knowledge of the phenomena despite the original false premise.**, **Scientific theories might rely on an interconnected framework where knowledge is retained even when isolated falsehoods do not impact critical parts of the theory.**
