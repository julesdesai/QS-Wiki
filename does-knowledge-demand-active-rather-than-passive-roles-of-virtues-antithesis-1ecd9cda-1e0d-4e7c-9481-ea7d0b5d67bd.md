## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a true belief that passively results from intellectual virtues initiated by another agent, not the person holding the belief. Intuitively, we judge that there is no knowledge because the virtues were not actively employed by the individual holding the belief**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires active engagement of intellectual virtues, suggesting passive virtue ownership is insufficient for knowledge**
