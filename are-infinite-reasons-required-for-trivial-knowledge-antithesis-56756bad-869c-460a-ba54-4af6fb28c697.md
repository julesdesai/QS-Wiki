## Content

**Consider a person knowing their own name based on repeated finite experiences. Infinitism would require an infinite, non-repeating justification series even for such mundane facts. It seems implausible that knowledge as everyday as knowing oneâ€™s own name demands such an elaborate justification, insisting rather unnecessarily on infinitude where finite reasoning seems plainly sufficient.**
