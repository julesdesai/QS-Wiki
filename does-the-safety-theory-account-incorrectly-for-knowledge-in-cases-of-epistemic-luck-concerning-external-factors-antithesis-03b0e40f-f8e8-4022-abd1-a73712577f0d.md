**Imagine a case where a person believes they will not be in a plane crash because statistics overwhelmingly support this belief. If they are right and do not crash, the true belief is based on luck since the non-occurrence of the crash is contingent on unrelated factors. Though their belief is true and safe in nearby worlds, intuitively we question whether they actually have knowledge.**
