## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief that accurately predicts a random event due to sheer guesswork. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite the truth of their belief.**, **A belief can be true and yet lack coherence with any other beliefs if it was formed independently of any evidence or rationale.**, **In cases where a belief arises from a lone intuition or uninformed guess, it is intuitively implausible to claim that the belief amounts to knowledge.**
