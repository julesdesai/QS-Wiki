## Content

**Consider a case where a person has strong beliefs justified by direct evidence, yet there exists indirect evidence unknown to them that suggests the belief is false. Intuitively, this indirect evidence seems to weaken the claim to knowledge despite the initial justified true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that all available evidence, direct or indirect, affects the status of knowledge. This principle suggests that justified true belief with no defeaters may not be sufficient for knowledge when indirect evidence is present.**
