## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief based on reliable evidence but still gets it right purely by chance. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **Even if in nearby possible worlds, where this person forms the same belief, it is not false, the randomness in the formation of the belief indicates a lack of knowledge.**
