## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a reliable cognitive process implanted without their awareness leading to true beliefs. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge because of the lack of cognitive integration with their existing beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires cognitive integration, which challenges the sufficiency of reliability alone.**
