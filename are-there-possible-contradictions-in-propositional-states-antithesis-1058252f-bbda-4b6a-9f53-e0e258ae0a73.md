## Content

**Consider a proposition that's justified and true for a subject, but later another justified belief runs contrary. Intuitively, knowledge in the initial belief seems undermined not by a truth per se but by conflicting propositional states.**, **Propositional conflicts need not always align with external truths acting as defeaters, suggesting complexity beyond the theory's scope.**
