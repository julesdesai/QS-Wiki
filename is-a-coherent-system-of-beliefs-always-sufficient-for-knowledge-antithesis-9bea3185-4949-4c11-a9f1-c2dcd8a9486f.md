**Envision a case where a personâ€™s belief is true, coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs, and includes empirical validation, yet the person arrived at this belief through unreliable means such as guessing.**, **Intuitively, it seems wrong to say the person has knowledge if the belief's grounding factors are unreliable, regardless of coherence.**
