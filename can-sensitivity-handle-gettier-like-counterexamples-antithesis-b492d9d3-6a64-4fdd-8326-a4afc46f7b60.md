## Content

**Suppose someone has a justified true belief under conditions where they would not hold the belief if it were false, yet their true belief stems from a lucky accident or misleading circumstances. Intuitively, their belief should not count as knowledge despite satisfying sensitivity, as shown by Gettier cases.**, **Gettier cases suggest that sensitivity may not capture all necessary conditions for knowledge, as beliefs derived from epistemic luck defy sensitivity yet lack knowledge status.**
