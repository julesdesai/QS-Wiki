## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a reliable process that is not an intellectual virtue, such as a well-functioning thermometer. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the temperature, even though the belief did not result from an intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be acquired through reliable processes even if they are not intellectual virtues. This principle together with the idea that the belief must result from intellectual virtue to constitute knowledge entails a contradiction.**
