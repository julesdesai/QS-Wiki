**Consider a scenario in which a person knew at a past time that Paris is the capital of France, they remember this now, and it accurately corresponds to reality now. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that they know it now because they remembered it accurately.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person previously knew a historical fact, they remember it now, but they fail to consider new evidence that the fact has since changed. Intuitively, we might judge that the person lacks current knowledge because they do not consider the present situation.**, **The mere accuracy and retention of past knowledge does not account for changes in context or new evidence that may affect the truth of the proposition.**
