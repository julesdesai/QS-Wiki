## Content

**Suppose a person learned a fact years ago and now remembers it correctly without recent evidence or current tracking of situations. Intuitively, we still consider this as knowledge, despite the absence of ongoing belief tracking.**, **Knowledge derived from memory might not require the active tracking the truth across possible situations to be valid, posing a challenge to the tracking requirement.**
