## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is pragmatically useful because it helps a person win a bet, but the evidence supporting the belief is weak. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is justified or that it is not justified. If we say it is justified, then practically useful but poorly supported beliefs would count as knowledge. If we say it is not justified, then practical usefulness alone cannot be sufficient for justification.**
