## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which multiple unrelated beliefs accidentally form a coherent set due to a confabulation error.**, **Intuitively, we would not say that such a coherent confabulation provides genuine justification for a belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification must involve knowledge about the methodology or process behind forming beliefs, not just their coherence.**
