## Content

**Consider a scenario where two individuals have identical evidence and beliefs, yet in almost all nearby worlds, one ends up with true beliefs while the other does not. Intuitively, luck plays too large a role in denying one of them knowledge, suggesting truth in nearby worlds alone is inadequate.**, **A plausible principle here is that factors beyond just truth in possible worlds must contribute to the stability of knowledge.**
