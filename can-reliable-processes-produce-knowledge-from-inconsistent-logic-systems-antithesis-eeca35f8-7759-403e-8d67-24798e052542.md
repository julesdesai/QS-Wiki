## Content

**Suppose there is a person who applies a system of logic consistently but that system is internally inconsistent, yet they often arrive at the truth. Intuitively, beliefs derived from this do not seem to constitute knowledge.**, **A belief formed from an inconsistent logical system may be true and reliably produced, yet still fail as knowledge due to the flawed process underlying the reliability.**
