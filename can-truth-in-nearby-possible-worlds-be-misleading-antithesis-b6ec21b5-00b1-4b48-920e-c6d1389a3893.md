## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person holds a justified true belief, but in all relevant nearby possible worlds, evidence that was pivotal for justification is revealed to be fabricated. Intuitively, this suggests that the truth of the proposition ceases to hold reliably, undercutting the beliefâ€™s safety.**, **In such scenarios, even with everything aligning in the actual world, knowledge seems fragile given the instability in nearby worlds.**
