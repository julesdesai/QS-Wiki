## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a justified true belief, but only due to lucky circumstances, making it a Gettier case. Intuitively, we would not count this as knowledge.**, **There is an underlying assumption that coherence with an infinite chain would prevent Gettier problems, but this might not address all instances where justified true beliefs fail to constitute knowledge.**, **No matter how vast the justificatory chain, if it does not preclude luck-based scenarios, it might fall short of solving the Gettier issue.**
