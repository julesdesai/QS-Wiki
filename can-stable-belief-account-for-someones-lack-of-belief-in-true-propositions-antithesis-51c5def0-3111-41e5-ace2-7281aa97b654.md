## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person encounters a true proposition but lacks any belief regarding it. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not have knowledge of the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires at least some degree of belief, making it difficult to claim knowledge without any belief.**
