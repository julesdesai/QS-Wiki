## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person, Jane, forms a belief about winning a lottery based on a fraudulent prediction, yet she wins due to the actual draw. Intuitively, we would either have to say that Jane knew she would win, given her belief and the outcome, or that she did not know because her winning was due to luck. If we claim that Jane knew, it seems contradictory to disqualify other forms of luck-determined truths as knowledge.**, **A plausible principle suggests that knowledge should be stable across different contexts of luck, such that accidental truths are not classified as knowledge.**, **While epistemic luck is negated as sufficient for knowledge, defining the boundaries of what constitutes mere luck remains contentious, suggesting that the anti-luck condition might not distinctly separate accidental truth from knowledge.**
