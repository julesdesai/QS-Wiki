## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a belief through a reliable intellectual virtue but without appropriately tracking the truth in varying conditions. Intuitively, we either have to say that this lack of truth-tracking means the belief is not knowledge or accept that knowledge can exist without truth-tracking. If we say the belief is knowledge, then knowledge allows for beliefs that might have been false under slightly different circumstances. If we say it is not knowledge, then intellectual virtue alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
