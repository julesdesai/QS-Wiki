## Content

**Consider an individual who believes and correctly justifies a proposition about the election outcome, ruling out all alternatives based on reputable polls. However, their belief is coincidentally true due to fraud affecting the results. Intuitively, despite the evidence, this person might not truly know the outcome**, **It is implausible for knowledge to rely solely on having eliminated alternatives when external unforeseen factors undermine the reasoning**
