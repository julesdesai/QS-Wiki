## Content

**A person might have a belief that is false yet arises from the exercise of intellectual virtue or competence.**, **Intuitively, one could argue that such a belief could still be seen as reliably formed, even if it is false.**, **A case in which a person makes an educated guess using solid reasoning, but the guess turns out to be false, challenges the idea that the presence of intellectual virtue requires the truth of the belief.**
