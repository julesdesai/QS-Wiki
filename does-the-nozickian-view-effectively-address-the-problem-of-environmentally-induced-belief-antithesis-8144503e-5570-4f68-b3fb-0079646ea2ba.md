## Content

**Consider a scenario in which there is a person in a room with deceptive evidence that supports a false belief, yet by coincidence, the person happens to hold the true belief due to environmental features they are unaware of.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, we would not consider them to have knowledge even if their belief tracks the truth due to coincidental environmental factors.**, **The influence of coincidental environmental factors questions the sufficiency of the Nozickian tracking conditions for constituting knowledge.**
