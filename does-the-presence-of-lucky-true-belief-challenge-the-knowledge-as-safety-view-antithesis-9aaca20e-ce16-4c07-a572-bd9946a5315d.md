## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person correctly guesses the outcome of a fair coin toss and believes it will land heads. The coin lands heads purely by chance, validating their belief. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows the coin will land heads because the truth of their belief was a matter of luck.**, **In this scenario, the person believes the proposition, the proposition is true, and in most nearby possible worlds where the person believes this proposition, the proposition is true, yet there is intuition that this is not knowledge due to the role of luck.**
