## Content

**Knowledge claims are often sensitive to the context in which they are made, such as depending on the stakes or interests at play.**, **Foundational empirical beliefs are expected to be context-independent, serving as a stable base for coherence.**, **The context-dependence of knowers conflicts with the need for stable foundational beliefs, suggesting an incomplete understanding of knowledge.**
