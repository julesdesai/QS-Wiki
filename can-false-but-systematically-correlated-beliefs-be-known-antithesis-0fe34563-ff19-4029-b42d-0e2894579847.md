## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes that a distant forest fire is happening because they see smoke on the horizon. In reality, the "smoke" is a controlled burn, and there is no actual fire threatening the forest. In this scenario, the belief arises from the same visual process that reliably indicates fire when there is smoke on the horizon, suggesting systematically correlated circumstances.**, **In this scenario, intuitively, we would not say the person knows there is a forest fire happening, since the actual fact of a threatening fire is absent despite the reliable correlation of smoke with fire.**
