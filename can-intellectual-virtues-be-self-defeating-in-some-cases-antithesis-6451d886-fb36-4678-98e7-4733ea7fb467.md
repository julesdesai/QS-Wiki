## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's overconfidence, traditionally not a virtue, results in both persistence and eventual true belief through exhaustive investigation, while humility would have led them to abandon the true belief prematurely. Intuitively, this creates a tension where a non-virtue results in knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that acknowledges some traits considered non-virtuous can sometimes lead to knowledge, challenging the necessity of intellectual virtues for all cases.**
