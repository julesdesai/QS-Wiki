## Content

**Consider a situation where Tom accurately knows the identity of a person in a room because of a justified mistaken belief, later corrected. Initially, Tom believed someone was the person due to a reflection, although the reflection was wrongly identified yet is coincidentally correct. Intuitively, Tom doesnâ€™t know the person's identity, since his belief is safely true by coincidence rather than reliable inference.**, **A belief that is true but partially based on false premises, even if safe, challenges the sufficiency of safe beliefs for knowledge.**
