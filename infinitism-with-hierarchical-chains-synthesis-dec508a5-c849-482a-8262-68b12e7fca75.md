## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification involves a primary infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons with any competing chains being subordinate**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and there exists a primary infinite, non-repeating chain of reasons justifying the belief**
