## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justified beliefs require a non-circular and non-regressive foundation of reasoning. This principle together with the assumption that beliefs must coherently align in a system suggests coherence alone fails to halt an infinite regress of justification for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence without foundational beliefs can adequately ground knowledge given the infinite regress problem it faces.**
