## Content

**A case in which a person believes a true proposition and the belief is safe, but the individual has forgotten the evidence that supports this belief. Intuitively, we might hesitate to call this knowledge because the link to evidence and reasoning is broken.**, **It's implausible to claim knowledge without access to the evidence or reasoning that made the belief safe, questioning the idea that just safety, truth, and belief are sufficient.**
