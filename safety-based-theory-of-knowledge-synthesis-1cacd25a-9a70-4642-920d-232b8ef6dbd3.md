## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition if the proposition is true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they do not believe the proposition if the proposition is false**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that in nearby possible worlds where they form the belief, the belief is still true**, **It is sufficient for knowledge that a person's belief remains safe from error in similar situations**
