## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone inadvertently forms a true belief, such as overhearing a conversation that leads to the correct belief about a current event, without making a conscious effort to inquire. Intuitively, we might judge that they have knowledge about the event despite not engaging in conscious intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible to hold that all knowledge requires conscious intellectual effort, challenging the view that intellectual virtue is necessary for knowledge.**
