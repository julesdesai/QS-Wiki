## Content

**A person can have justified true belief through coherence without having knowledge, as shown in Gettier cases.**, **Gettier scenarios highlight situations where coherent belief systems fail to deliver knowledge due to accidental truths.**, **Coherence does not address the gap between justified true belief and knowledge caused by cases of fortuitous truth.**, **A belief being part of a coherent system does not prevent it from being true merely by chance, undermining genuine knowledge claims.**
