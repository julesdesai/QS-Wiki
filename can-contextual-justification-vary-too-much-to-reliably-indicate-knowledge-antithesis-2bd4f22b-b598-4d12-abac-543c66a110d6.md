## Content

**Consider a situation where the contextual justification for a belief changes rapidly, leading to the belief alternating between being justified and unjustified; intuitively, constant shifts seem problematic for maintaining stable knowledge.**, **A case where different contexts provide conflicting justifications could lead to a situation where coherence within one context contradicts coherence within another, suggesting an instability in determining knowledge based on context.**
