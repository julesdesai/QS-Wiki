## Content

**Consider a situation where an individual believes a false proposition as part of a coherent network of beliefs established on misleading but coherent evidence. Intuitively, the truth condition for knowledge should retain primacy, which is diluted under coherence endorsement of systemic belief cohesion.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth is a non-negotiable component of knowledge, and any theory of knowledge that allows for coherence without truth undermines the fundamental truth requirement.**
