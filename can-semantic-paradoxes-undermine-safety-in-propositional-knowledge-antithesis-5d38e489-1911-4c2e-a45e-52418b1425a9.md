## Content

**Consider a situation where a person knows a sentence is false, but this involves paradoxical sentences like “This sentence is false.” Intuitively, engaging with such statements doesn’t seem to convey knowing, as safety hinges on coherence that paradoxes lack.**, **A statement inducing paradoxes obtains safety by ignoring contextual inconsistencies, challenging reliable evaluation for truth even if sometimes “safe” in local realities.**
