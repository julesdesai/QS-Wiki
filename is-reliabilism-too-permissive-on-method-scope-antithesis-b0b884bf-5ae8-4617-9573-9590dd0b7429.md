## Content

**Imagine a process regarded as reliable that operates in a limited domain but fails elsewhere, such as a method capable in specific scientific contexts yet fails in mundane settings. Intuitively, we might judge that calling it reliable, hence knowledge-conferring everywhere, is inappropriate.**, **Knowledge implies a certain consistency of reliability, necessitating process validation across broader contexts beyond narrow applicability.**
