## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a true belief arises from distinct cognitive virtues without integration or coherence with other beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not fully know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that integration with a broader belief system is important for knowledge. This principle together with the lack of coherence entails that the belief might not constitute knowledge.**
