## Content

**Suppose that a person believes that 2+2=4. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows this mathematical truth or that they do not. If we say the person knows about this case, then sensitivity fails because the belief could not be false even in the most extreme conditions. Therefore, suggesting sensitivity cannot account for necessary truths**
