**Consider a scientist who believes in a theoretical aspect of quantum mechanics, proven true, yet too ahead of its time to hold practical utility. Intuitively, this still resembles knowledge in our common understanding.**, **There is a plausible principle that not all knowledge requires immediate practical utility, contradicting the necessity of practical usefulness.**
