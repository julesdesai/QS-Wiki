## Content

**Consider a case where an individual is in a context that requires high standards for justification of belief, such as a courtroom setting, and believes a proposition that is true and justified under everyday conditions but lacks the required rigorous evidence. In such a context, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition due to inappropriate justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires justification exceeding mere belief unless the context modifies requirements for knowing, yet varying contexts may lead to inconsistency. This principle suggests that knowledge cannot vary arbitrarily with changes in context or standards.**
