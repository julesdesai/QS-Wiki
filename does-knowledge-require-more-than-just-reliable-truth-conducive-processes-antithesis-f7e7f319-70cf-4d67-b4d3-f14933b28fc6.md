## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone reliably infers truths by reading tarot cards and coincidentally their predictions consistently come true. Intuitively, we would either have to say that they have knowledge or that there is something inadequate about the reliability. If we say they have knowledge about each outcome, then it seems counterintuitive. If we say there is something inadequate, then reliability alone is not sufficient for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that the method of forming a belief affects whether it can be considered knowledge, beyond just the reliability of truth production.**
