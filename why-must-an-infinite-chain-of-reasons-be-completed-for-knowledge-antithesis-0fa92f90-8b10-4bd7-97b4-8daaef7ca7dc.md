## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person claims to know a proposition because they can provide a very long but finite chain of reasons for their belief. Intuitively, this seems sufficient for knowledge in real-world contexts.**, **There is a plausible principle that human epistemic practices are based on finite reasoning. This principle together with the idea that knowledge requires infinite reasons entails a disconnect between theory and practice.**
