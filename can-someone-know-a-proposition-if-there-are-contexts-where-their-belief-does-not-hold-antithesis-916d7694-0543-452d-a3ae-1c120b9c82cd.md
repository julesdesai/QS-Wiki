## Content

**Consider a scenario where Carla believes it is raining, it is indeed raining, and she holds this belief across various casual conversational contexts but not in contexts involving scientific scrutiny. Intuitively, we would question if she truly knows it is raining.**, **Suppose it is argued that knowing a proposition requires the belief to hold in all contexts where challenges to the belief might reasonably arise. Intuitively, when Carlaâ€™s belief does not hold in scientific contexts, we do not confidently assert she knows.**
