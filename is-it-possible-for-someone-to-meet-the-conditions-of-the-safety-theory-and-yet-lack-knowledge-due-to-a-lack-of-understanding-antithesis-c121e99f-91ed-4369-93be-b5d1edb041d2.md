## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a complex mathematical theorem simply because an authority told them it is true, the theorem is true, and in nearly all nearby possible worlds where they believe it, the theorem is true as well. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the theorem or they do not. If we say they know, this conflicts with the intuition that understanding is necessary for knowledge.**
