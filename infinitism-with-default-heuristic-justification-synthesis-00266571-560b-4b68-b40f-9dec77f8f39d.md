**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification can involve an infinite chain where default heuristics provide immediate but defeasible reasons**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and default heuristics provide initial justification in the infinite chain**
