## Content

**Suppose a person knows that their belief in a proposition is grounded in expert consensus. Later, realization of an unknown flaw in the expertsâ€™ methodology emerges. Intuitively, one might say the belief was not knowledge, even when the flaw was unknown.**, **This suggests the presence of unknown defeaters can affect the status of a belief, challenging the robustness of the no-defeaters condition.**
