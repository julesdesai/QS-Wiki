## Content

**A belief can be justified and true yet lack coherence with a belief system traditionally understood due to luck, known as the Gettier problem.**, **Consider an example where a person believes a proposition based on strong but misleading evidence, and the proposition turns out to be true due to unexpected factors, this belief might cohere internally but still lacks justified true belief.**, **If coherence fails to address such Gettier-style cases, it suggests that coherence might not suffice for the kind of justified true belief knowledge requires.**
