## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief through a guess, and despite the low likelihood, the belief is true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that they merely guessed correctly. If we say they know the proposition, then it seems to conflict with the idea that knowledge requires reliability. If we say they merely guessed correctly, then true belief formed through unreliable guessing is not knowledge.**
