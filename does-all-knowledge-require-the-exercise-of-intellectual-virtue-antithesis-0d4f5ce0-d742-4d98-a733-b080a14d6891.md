## Content

**Consider a case in which person B is presented with overwhelming evidence that a plane crash survivor has been found, and B believes accurately because of this evidence. In this case, the belief is true, but B's exercise of intellectual virtue or ability is minimal as the evidence is presented so clearly that it requires little cognitive effort. Intuitively, B's belief appears to constitute knowledge.**
