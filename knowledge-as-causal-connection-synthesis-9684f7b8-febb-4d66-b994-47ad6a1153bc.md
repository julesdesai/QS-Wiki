**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that there is an appropriate causal connection between the truth of the proposition and the belief in the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and there is an appropriate causal connection**
[END]
