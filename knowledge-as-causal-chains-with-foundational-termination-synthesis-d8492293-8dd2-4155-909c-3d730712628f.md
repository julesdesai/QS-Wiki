**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true**, **For knowledge to avoid regress, causal chains terminate in basic beliefs that do not require further causal explanation**
