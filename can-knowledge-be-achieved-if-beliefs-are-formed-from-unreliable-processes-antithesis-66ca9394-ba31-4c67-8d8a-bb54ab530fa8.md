## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition because they relied on a generally unreliable method, like flipping a coin. Intuitively, either we say the person without knowledge or with knowledge but this violates the principle of requiring reliable methods.**, **Consider a scenario where a person's belief in a true proposition originates from a source known to often produce false beliefs; the person's accuracy is coincidental if they know the belief. Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge in this scenario.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be knowledge, not only must it be true and justified, but the method used to form it must be reliable.**
