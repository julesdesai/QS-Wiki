## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on reliable evidence, and the proposition is true, but only by chance in nearby possible worlds. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must not rely on luck. This principle together with a belief being true by chance entails that the belief does not qualify as knowledge.**
