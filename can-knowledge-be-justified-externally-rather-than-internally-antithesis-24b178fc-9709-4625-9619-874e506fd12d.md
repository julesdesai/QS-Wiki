## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief based on reliable testimony from an expert, but they lack awareness of the reliability. Intuitively, we might judge that the person has knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be achieved through external means like reliable processes or expert testimony. This principle, together with a scenario where external factors provide justification, suggests that internal justification may not be necessary for knowledge.**
