## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person misremembers details surrounding the proposition but still believes a core truth correctly. In such a scenario, intuitively we might resist the idea that the person truly knows the proposition because their overall understanding is flawed.**, **It is plausible that accurate memory of surrounding circumstances is integral to claiming current knowledge through memory. Together with common cases of misremembering context while retaining a core truth, this questions the sufficiency of memory retention alone for knowledge.**, **Cases where crucial contextual details are incorrect but the core belief happens to be true challenge the value of accurate retention alone in determining current knowledge.**
