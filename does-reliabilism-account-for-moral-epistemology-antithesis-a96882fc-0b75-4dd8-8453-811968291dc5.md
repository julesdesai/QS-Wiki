## Content

**There is a plausible principle that moral knowledge requires a form of justification reflecting moral reasoning. This principle together with the claim that moral knowledge can be purely reliable without moral reasoning entails a challenge to reliabilism in moral contexts.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at moral truths through a reliable but non-reflective process without any understanding of the moral reasoning. In such a scenario, intuitively we would question the adequacy of such a process for moral knowledge.**
