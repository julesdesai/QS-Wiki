## Content

**Consider a scenario involving knowledge of distant galaxies. It may be true, believed, and justified, but not impact actions or decisions. Intuitively, this knowledge seems valid despite lacking practical application.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can exist independently of its application to decision-making or action. This principle suggests that practical consequences are not a necessary component of knowledge.**
