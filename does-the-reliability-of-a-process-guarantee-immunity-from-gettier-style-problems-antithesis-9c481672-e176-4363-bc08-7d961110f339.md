## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, via a usually reliable process of perception, misidentifies an object due to unusual conditions but still arrives at a true belief. This resembles a Gettier case where intuitively, the person does not have knowledge.**, **Imagine that a person believes they see a real barn in "barn facade county" where fake barns are common, yet this time the perception happens to be of a real barn. The reliable perception does not seem to confer genuine knowledge in this case.**
