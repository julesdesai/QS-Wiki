## Content

**Consider a case where a person recalls a true belief without retaining awareness of its original justification. Intuitively, the person could still possess knowledge, especially if the belief was originally well justified.**, **The necessity for continuous awareness risks disqualifying instances of knowledge preserved via memory, where original justification awareness is lost over time.**
