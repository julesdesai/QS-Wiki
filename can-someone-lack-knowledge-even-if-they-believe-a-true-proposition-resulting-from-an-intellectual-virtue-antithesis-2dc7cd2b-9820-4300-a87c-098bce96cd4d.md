## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief through intellectual virtue, yet lacks awareness of crucial evidence for the proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not possess knowledge because they are ignorant of relevant evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that being aware of relevant evidence is necessary for knowledge. This principle entails that belief resulting from intellectual virtue without such awareness is insufficient for knowledge.**
