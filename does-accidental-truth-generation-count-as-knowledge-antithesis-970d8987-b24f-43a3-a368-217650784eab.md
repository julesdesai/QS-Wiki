## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person believes a true proposition because of sheer luck or accident, such as guessing the correct answer on a multiple-choice test without any knowledge or competence. Intuitively, one might say that the person does not truly know the proposition because their belief did not arise from epistemic competence or virtue.**, **It is implausible that a belief formed purely by accident or luck without epistemic virtues amounts to knowledge.**
