## Content

**Imagine a scientist predicts a solar eclipse based on flawed data due to solar activity and not the correct orbital calculations yet accurately predicts the event by chance. Intuitively, this doesn't track the truth as it lacks a causal connection.**, **Beliefs should track the truth through correct causal pathways, not accidental alignments, for genuine truth-tracking.**
