## Content

**Consider a case where a person, Carol, derives a true belief from a justified false premise, but the belief becomes true due to an unexpected fact. Intuitively, Carol's belief doesn't seem like knowledge, highlighting a problem for defining knowledge merely by excluding epistemic luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a strong link between justification and truth beyond the exclusion of epistemic luck. This principle suggests that epistemic luck exclusion alone cannot account for genuine knowledge.**
