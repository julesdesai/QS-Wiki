## Content

**There is a plausible principle that truth is stable and does not change between contexts. This principle together with the idea that contextual standards affect whether a proposition is known creates tension with the fixed nature of truth.**, **If the variability of context influences knowledge, while truth stays stable, then knowledge might be more fragile or unreliable than traditionally conceived.**
