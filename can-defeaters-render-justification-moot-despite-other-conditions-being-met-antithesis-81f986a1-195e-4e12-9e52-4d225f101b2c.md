## Content

**In a scenario where a personâ€™s belief is true and justified, but there is a significant defeater undermining the justification.**, **Intuitively, the presence of a significant defeater seems to nullify the justification, thus the belief is not knowledge.**, **This undermining suggests justification ought to remain strong and unchallenged for knowledge.**
