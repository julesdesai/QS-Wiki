## Content

**There is a plausible principle that belief is necessary for knowledge. This principle together with the observation of deeply ingrained subconscious knowledge, like language fluency, entails that a person can know a language without the conscious belief statement about grammar rules.**, **Consider a scenario where a person uses correct grammar subconsciously without ever forming any corresponding belief about those grammatical rules. In such a scenario, intuitively, we might say the person knows the grammar without ever having the corresponding beliefs.**
