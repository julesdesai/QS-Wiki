## Content

**Consider a person with high intelligence who consistently forms true beliefs across various domains because of their cognitive intellect.**, **High intelligence alone does not qualify as an intellectual virtue since it could include traits not covered by virtue epistemology.**, **In cases where intelligence leads to true beliefs, it seems the person knows these beliefs, yet virtue epistemology would not classify them as knowledgeable if those beliefs don't specifically arise from virtue.**
