## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, Tom, believes a proposition because he was told by a reliable source in the past that such propositions are generally true without direct evidence of the particular instance. Intuitively, we have to say that Tom knows the proposition despite lacking a direct causal link between the proposition's truth and his belief.**
