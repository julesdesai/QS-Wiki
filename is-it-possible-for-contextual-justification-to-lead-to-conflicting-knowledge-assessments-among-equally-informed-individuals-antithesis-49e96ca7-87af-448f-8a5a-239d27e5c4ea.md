## Content

**Imagine two individuals who have access to different bodies of evidence due to differing contexts, leading to varied justifications for a belief in the same proposition. Intuitively, this could result in one person being said to know a proposition while the other does not.**, **The potential for conflicting judgments about knowledge based on contextual justification suggests an implausibility in using context to universally define knowledge.**
