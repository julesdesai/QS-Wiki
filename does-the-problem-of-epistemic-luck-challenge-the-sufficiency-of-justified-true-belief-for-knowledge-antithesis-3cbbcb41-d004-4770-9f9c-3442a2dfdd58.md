## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge must exclude cases of epistemic luck, which refers to situations where a belief happens to be true by sheer chance. This principle together with the notion of justified true belief entails that justified true belief cannot account for knowledge if it includes cases of epistemic luck, highlighting that justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge.**
