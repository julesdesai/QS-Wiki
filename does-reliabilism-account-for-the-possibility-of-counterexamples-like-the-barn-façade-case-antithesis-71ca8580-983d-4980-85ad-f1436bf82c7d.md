## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is in a region filled with fake barn façades except for one real barn, and they form a belief upon seeing the only real barn. Intuitively, this does not seem to be a case of knowledge, since the formation of the belief is subject to significant environmental luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that the mere reliability of a belief-forming process is not enough for knowledge if the believer cannot distinguish relevant alternatives, such as fake barns.**
