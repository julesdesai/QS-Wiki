## Content

**Consider a situation in which a person knows the chances of winning a particular lottery are extremely low, yet they believe they will lose. Intuitively, if their belief is true, they would not be said to know they would lose merely because the belief was not easily false due to the odds.**, **If the safety condition is applied, the person's belief meets the condition since it would not easily have been false, but intuitively, they do not have knowledge.**
