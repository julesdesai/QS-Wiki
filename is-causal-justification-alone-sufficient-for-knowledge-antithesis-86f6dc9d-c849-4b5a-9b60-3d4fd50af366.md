## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a belief can be causally connected to a truth without being justified in the right way. This principle together with the requirement for causal connection entails that inappropriate justifications can lead to beliefs being true merely by chance.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief about the time after looking at a broken clock that just happens to be showing the correct time. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the time.**
