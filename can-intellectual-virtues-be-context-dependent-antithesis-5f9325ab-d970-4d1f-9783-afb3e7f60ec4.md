## Content

**Imagine a case where a person exhibits intellectual virtues by being skeptical and cautious, appropriate for a scientific inquiry, but uses the same virtues in casual conversation, leading to misunderstanding. Intuitively, we would see this as a misapplication of virtue.**, **If intellectual virtues can be context-dependent, it implies that applying these virtues universally is inadequate for defining knowledge.**
