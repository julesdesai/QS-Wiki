## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition due to random chance rather than through a coherent system of beliefs. Intuitively, this seems more like a lucky guess rather than genuine knowledge.**, **A principle stating that knowledge requires a coherent system of beliefs suggests that if a belief results from random chance, it is not coherent and therefore cannot be considered knowledge.**
