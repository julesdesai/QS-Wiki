## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person forms a belief based on information unwittingly disclosed by an unreliable source but that turns out to be true by chance. The intuition here suggests this is not knowledge.**, **The principle is that knowledge requires evidence from reliable and purposeful sources, where the source's intention aids in acquiring truth. Accidental truth from an unwitting source undermines the claim of robust evidential support.**
