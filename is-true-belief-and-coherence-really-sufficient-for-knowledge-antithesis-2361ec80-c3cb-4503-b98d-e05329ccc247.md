## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition because of a lucky guess. Intuitively, this belief does not constitute knowledge, even if it is true and coheres with other beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just true belief and coherence; it requires a justified basis for belief. True belief acquired by coincidence lacks this justification.**
