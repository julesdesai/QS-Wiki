## Content

**Imagine a situation where someone believes a proposition due to wishful thinking, and the proposition is true, but they lack any reasonable justification for that belief. Intuitively, it seems that despite the truth of the belief, the person does not possess knowledge.**, **This suggests that truth, while necessary, may not be sufficient for knowledge without adequate justification.**
