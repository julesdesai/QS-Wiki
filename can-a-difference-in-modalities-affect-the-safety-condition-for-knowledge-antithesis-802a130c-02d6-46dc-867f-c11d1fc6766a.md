## Content

**Consider a situation where what is safely held in possible worlds of one modality, such as temporal worlds where a person's belief consistently remains true, differs from other modalities such as conceptual worlds where the belief might be false due to different assumptions.**, **Intuitively, scenarios that differ across modalities challenge the coherency of safety as a sufficient condition for knowledge.**
