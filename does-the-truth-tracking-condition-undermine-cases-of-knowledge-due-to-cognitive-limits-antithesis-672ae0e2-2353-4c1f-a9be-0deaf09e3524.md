## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person cannot conceive of alternative scenarios in which the proposition is false because of cognitive limitations. Intuitively, we still recognize such a person as knowing the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, a person must recognize potential scenarios in which the belief could be false.**
