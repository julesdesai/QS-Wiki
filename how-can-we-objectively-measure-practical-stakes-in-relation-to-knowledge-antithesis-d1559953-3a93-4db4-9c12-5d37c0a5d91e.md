**Consider a situation in which Carla must decide whether to cross a bridge she believes is safe. The practical stakes are high as her life is in danger if she's wrong. Intuitively, the stakes seem subjective because another person's assessment of high or low stakes may differ from Carla's.**, **A plausible principle is that if stakes affect knowledge, we should be able to measure them consistently and objectively. If stakes vary between individuals in the same situation, then our ability to measure them remains subjective and inconsistent.**, **It is implausible that there exists an objective method to quantify stakes such that it would universally affect the standards for justified belief.**
