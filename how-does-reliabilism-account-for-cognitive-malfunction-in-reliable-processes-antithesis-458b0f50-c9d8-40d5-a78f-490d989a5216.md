**Reliabilism asserts that a belief that results from a reliable process qualifies as knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario wherein a person forms a belief through a normally reliable visual perception, but due to temporary cognitive malfunction like fatigue or intoxication, the belief is inaccurate.**, **In such cases, intuitively, the belief should not count as knowledge even though the process is generally reliable.**
