## Content

**Consider a process that is reliable for a specific set of cases but fails outside that set. A person forms a belief in one of these specific, successful cases. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge, as the unreliability of the process in other cases undermines confidence in the knowledge claim.**, **There is a plausible principle that processes must be universally reliable to qualify as knowledge-producing. This principle together with the process's selective reliability suggests that the belief does not amount to knowledge.**
