## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which the person unconsciously holds a belief that is true, and this belief results from previously exercised intellectual virtues without current conscious reflection**, **It is implausible that unconscious beliefs can constitute knowledge, as conscious exercise of virtues is often thought necessary for knowledge, which questions whether mere causal derivation from virtues suffices for knowledge**
