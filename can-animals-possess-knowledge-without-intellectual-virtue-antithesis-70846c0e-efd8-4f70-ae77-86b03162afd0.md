## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an animal, like a squirrel, navigates its environment effectively and with true beliefs about food sources, yet lacks intellectual virtue as humans conceive it. Intuitively, we might judge that the squirrel "knows" its environment in a relevant sense.**, **It is implausible to deny such attributions of knowledge to animals. This implausibility suggests that intellectual virtue should not be a necessary requirement for attributions of knowledge across all entities.**
