## Content

**Consider the logical coherence required in an infinite chain of justifications. Intuitively, the longer and more complex a chain becomes, the greater the risk of eventual inconsistency or incoherence between the reasons.**, **There is a plausible principle stating that coherence is critical for valid justification, and maintaining consistent reasoning infinitely may challenge this coherence requirement.**
