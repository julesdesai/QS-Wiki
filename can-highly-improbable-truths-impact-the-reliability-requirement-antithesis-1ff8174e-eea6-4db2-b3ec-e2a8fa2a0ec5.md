## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a highly improbable event will occur, the proposition is true, and belief is based on a reliable process like probabilistic reasoning. Intuitively, acknowledging such knowledge would challenge the reliability requirement because the truth occurrence is so improbable.**, **It is implausible to accept that highly improbable truths do not affect reliability when, by chance, they transpire and generate a true belief.**
