## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Sarah, believes a proposition, like "I have enough gas to reach the next city." The stakes are very high because running out of gas would leave her stranded in a dangerous area. Even if she has justification based on her car's gas gauge, intuitively, we would judge that her justification needs to be stronger due to the high stakes.**, **Consider a scenario where a person, John, believes a proposition, like "I have enough gas to reach the next city." The stakes are very low because running out of gas would only be a minor inconvenience. Here, intuitively, we would judge that weaker justification is sufficient.**
