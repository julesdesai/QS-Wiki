## Content

**Suppose we consider a person, Mike, who remembers a past event accurately and thus believes a proposition about it. The causal connection exists between the past event and Mike's current belief through memory. However, the direct causal chain from event to current belief is interrupted by time and ongoing mental processes, leading to the intuition that such memory-based beliefs still constitute knowledge.**
