## Content

**Suppose a person, Alex, believes that their friend is in the office because they see their friend's car in the parking lot.**, **Alex's belief is true, and Alex's belief arises from an intellectual virtue of careful observation.**, **However, it is merely accidental that Alex's belief is true because the friend borrowed someone else's car.**, **Intuitively, accidental truth does not seem sufficient for knowledge, which challenges the sufficiency condition of belief, truth, and intellectual virtue.**
