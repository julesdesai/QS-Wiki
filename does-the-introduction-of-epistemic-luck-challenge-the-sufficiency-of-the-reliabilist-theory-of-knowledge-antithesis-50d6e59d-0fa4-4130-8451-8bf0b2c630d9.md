## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition through a reliable cognitive process merely by chance. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge excludes luck. This principle, together with the scenario, entails that a belief produced by a reliable process does not necessarily amount to knowledge if luck is involved.**
