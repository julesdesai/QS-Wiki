## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual relies on a source purely based on habit without any cognitive evaluation of reliability. Intuitively, we either have to say that this results in knowledge or it does not. If we say it does result in knowledge, then recognizing cognitive evaluation in knowledge attribution is undermined. If we say it does not result in knowledge, then mere habitual trust is insufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a cognitive assessment of the source's credibility and not merely habit-based trust.**
