## Content

**Imagine a person looking at a digital clock reading "3:00 PM" and believing it is 3:00 PM. If it happens that the clock stopped exactly at 3:00 PM, we might intuitively deny the person knows the time.**, **Even if the clock had continued running, any scenario where the clock would read an incorrect time does not impact the current truth of their belief, challenging sensitivity.**
