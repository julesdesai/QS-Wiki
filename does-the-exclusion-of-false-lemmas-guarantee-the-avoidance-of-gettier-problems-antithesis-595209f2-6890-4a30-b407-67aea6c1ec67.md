## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person concludes a truth by pure coincidence, after all their justified reasons (accurate except for one false element) were actually irrelevant to the outcome.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge because the truth held for reasons other than the justification, which gives rise to the Gettier problem.**
