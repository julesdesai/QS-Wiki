## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and no defeaters currently exist.**, **There could arise a situation where new potential defeaters are introduced at any moment, calling into question the stability of knowledge.**, **It is implausible for an account of knowledge to be so temporally unstable.**
