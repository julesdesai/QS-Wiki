**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is part of a coherent system of beliefs assessed by probabilistic coherence**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, the belief coheres probabilistically with a system of beliefs**
