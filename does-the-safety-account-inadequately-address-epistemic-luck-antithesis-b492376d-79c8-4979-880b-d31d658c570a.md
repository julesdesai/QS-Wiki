**Parent:** [Knowledge as Safety](knowledge-as-safety-synthesis-951b308a-d743-471e-b239-8d05feac0df2.md)

## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should exclude significant luck. This principle together with scenarios where a true belief results from happenstance, like guessing, entails a challenge to the idea that the truth of a proposition in nearby possible worlds suffices for knowledge.**
