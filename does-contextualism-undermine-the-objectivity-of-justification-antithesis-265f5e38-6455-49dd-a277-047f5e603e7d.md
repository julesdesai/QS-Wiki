## Content

**Justification is typically viewed as an objective requirement for knowledge. Intuitively, if justification is context-sensitive, then its objectivity might be compromised, leading us to question the reliability of what counts as sufficient justification across different contexts.**, **If justification varies with context, the concept of being justified becomes more fluid, which could result in a breakdown of epistemic rigor.**
