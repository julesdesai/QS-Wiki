## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a reliable cognitive process due to a malfunction that normally produces true beliefs but does so randomly in this case. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, despite the process being reliable.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should exclude cases of accidentally true beliefs. This principle together with the scenario of malfunctioning cognitive processes entails that reliability is insufficient for knowledge.**
