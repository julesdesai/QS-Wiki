## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which scientific knowledge evolves over time, building on theories that are ever less self-evident. Intuitively, scientific progress allows for knowledge to grow in complexity and detail.**, **It is implausible that the foundational model, requiring self-evidence for basic beliefs, can accommodate the complex inferential and empirical methods characteristic of scientific progress.**
