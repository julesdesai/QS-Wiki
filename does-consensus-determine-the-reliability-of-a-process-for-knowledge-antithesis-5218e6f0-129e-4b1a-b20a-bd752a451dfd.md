## Content

**Consider a scenario where a community believes a certain medical process to be reliable despite lacking empirical validation.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that community consensus alone on the reliability of a process wouldn't suffice for knowledge if later proven to be ineffective.**, **The intuition is that external validation, not mere consensus, is crucial to establishing a reliable knowledge-conducive process.**
