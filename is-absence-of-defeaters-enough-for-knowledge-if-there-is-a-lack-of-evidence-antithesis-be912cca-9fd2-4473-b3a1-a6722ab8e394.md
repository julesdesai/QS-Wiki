**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** be912cca-9fd2-4473-b3a1-a6722ab8e394

## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition because they flipped a coin and it landed on heads, with the proposition having no direct relationship to the coin's result. Intuitively, we would not regard such a belief as knowledge.**, **Even when there are no explicit defeaters, a belief formed in the absence of relevant evidence or rational grounding does not satisfy our intuitive understanding of knowledge.**
