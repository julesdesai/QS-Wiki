## Content

**Imagine a situation where an individual possesses a true belief on the basis of mere speculation or no evidence at all. Intuitively, we might argue that knowledge is not possible in this case because there is no justification for the belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires some form of justification. This principle, coupled with the speculative belief, suggests that the individual does not genuinely possess knowledge.**
