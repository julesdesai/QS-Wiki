## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition simply by coincidence, like guessing correctly without evidence. Intuitively, we would not judge that the person knows the proposition, as their belief lacks robust justification.**, **Coincidental belief that happens to be true poses a challenge to the sufficiency of truth and sensitivity for knowledge, as genuine understanding appears to require more than a nice coincidence.**, **Coincidence in belief, even when aligned with truth, highlights a limitation of sensitivity, as it fails to provide a sufficient condition for knowledge on its own.**
