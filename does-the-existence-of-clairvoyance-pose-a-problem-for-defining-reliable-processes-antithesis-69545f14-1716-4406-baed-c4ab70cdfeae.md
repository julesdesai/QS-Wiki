## Content

**Imagine a person has a true belief formed by clear and accurate clairvoyant powers, yet the intuition is strong that they do not possess knowledge because clairvoyance is not a recognized reliable cognitive process.**, **Cognitive processes typically deemed reliable are grounded in empirical and logical evidence, while clairvoyance lacks such support, making intuitions against it being knowledge significant.**
