## Content

**Reliabilism claims that a belief-forming process must be reliable for the belief to count as knowledge.**, **There is a difficulty in specifying which type of belief-forming process is relevant given the multitude of possible relevant processes, known as the "generality problem".**, **This generality problem arises because varying the description of the belief-forming process can alter its reliability assessment without any principled way to determine the correct description.**
