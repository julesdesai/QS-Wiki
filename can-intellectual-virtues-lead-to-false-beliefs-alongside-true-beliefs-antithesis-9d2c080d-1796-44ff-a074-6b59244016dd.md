## Content

**Consider a situation where the same intellectual virtue leads a person to form a true belief in one instance and a false belief in another, depending on circumstantial differences. Intuitively, if the virtue leads to knowledge at times and error at others, its role in constituting knowledge is questionable.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting that what leads to error cannot be a reliable source of knowledge, thus challenging the necessity of intellectual virtues for knowledge.**
