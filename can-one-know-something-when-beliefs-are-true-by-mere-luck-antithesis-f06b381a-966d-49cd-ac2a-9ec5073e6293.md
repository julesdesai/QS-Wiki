## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a barn in a landscape full of fake barn facades. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know there is a barn, even if there actually is one real barn in that landscape.**, **A belief being true only by luck or chance challenges whether it can be considered knowledge, given that the belief could easily have been false.**
