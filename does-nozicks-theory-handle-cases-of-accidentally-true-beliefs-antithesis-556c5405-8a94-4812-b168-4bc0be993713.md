## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition because of a reliable method, but the belief is true due to a completely unrelated factor. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is implausible that merely having a belief that tracks the truth conditionally in the way Nozick describes ensures that one has knowledge given that belief may be true due to an unrelated factor.**
