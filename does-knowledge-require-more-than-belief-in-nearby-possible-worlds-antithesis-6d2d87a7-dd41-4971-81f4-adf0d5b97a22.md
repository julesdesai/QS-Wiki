## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a true belief based on a reliable process, but the same process in nearby possible worlds typically leads to false beliefs. Intuitively, this indicates that merely checking nearby worlds where the belief is held is insufficient to claim knowledge.**, **In a concrete example, a doctor diagnosing a patient based on symptoms accurately, but in many similar cases nearby, the symptoms are misleading, suggesting that the doctor does not know the correct diagnosis but is merely correct by accident.**
