## Content

**Suppose a person gains a true belief through an unusual or deviant causal chain stemming from a reliable process, in such a scenario it seems unintuitive to claim they have knowledge.**, **Consider a case where a person's belief, despite originating from reliable methods, involves a series of abnormal steps which makes the belief true only by accident, challenging its status as knowledge.**
