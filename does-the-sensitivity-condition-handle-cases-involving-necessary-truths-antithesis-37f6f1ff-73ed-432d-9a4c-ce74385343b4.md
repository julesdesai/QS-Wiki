**Consider a scenario where a person, Alex, believes a mathematical truth such as "2+2=4." In such a scenario, even if "2+2=4" were false, Alex would still believe it due to the nature of necessary truths.**, **It is plausible that knowledge should account for necessary truths, which remain true in all possible worlds. The sensitivity condition does not apply well to necessary truths, making it inadequate.**
