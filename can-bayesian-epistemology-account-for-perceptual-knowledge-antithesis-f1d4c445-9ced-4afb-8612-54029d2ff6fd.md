## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person sees a tree and forms the belief that there is a tree in front of them based on their perceptual experience. This belief is not derived from explicit probabilistic reasoning but rather immediate perception.**, **It is implausible that all perceptual knowledge requires alignment with probabilistic reasoning based on evidence, since perception often precedes deliberate reasoning.**
