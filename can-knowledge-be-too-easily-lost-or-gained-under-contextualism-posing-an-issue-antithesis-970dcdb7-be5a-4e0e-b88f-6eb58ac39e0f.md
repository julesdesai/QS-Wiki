## Content

**Suppose a person knows a proposition in one context and does not know it in another due to a simple shift in standards. Intuitively, this makes knowledge seem precarious and less stable than traditionally considered.**, **It is implausible that knowledge should be so readily lost or gained with slight changes in conversational context. This suggests a lack of robustness in the concept of knowledge if contextualism is accepted.**
