## Content

**Consider a scientist employing intellectual virtues to develop a theory, but the community's epistemic standards—for example, theoretical paradigms or peer review—disregard her findings. Intuitively, the community's dismissal affects whether her belief counts as knowledge, despite her virtues.**, **The notion that community validation plays a role in knowledge challenges the idea that individual intellectual virtue alone suffices for knowledge.**
