## Content

**Consider a case where someone has a justified true belief based on current evidence, but there existed evidence in the past that would have defeated this justification if it were known. Intuitively, it seems that the person's current knowledge should not be threatened by past, inaccessible information.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should depend on present justification and truth, and not on historical contingencies. This principle together with requiring no defeaters entails a disqualification of knowledge due to past irrelevancies.**
