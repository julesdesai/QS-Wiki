## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, due to reliable intellectual virtues, forms a true belief about a proposition. However, unforeseen factors create situations where the propositions are accidentally true. Intuitively, we judge that the person does not truly know the proposition though the belief stems from intellectual virtues**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge entails a degree of immunity from such lucky coincidences, suggesting that the conjunction of truth, belief, and intellectual virtue alone is insufficient for knowledge**
