## Content

**Suppose a person has strong evidence for a true proposition, such as seeing rain when it's raining, but also has misleading evidence suggesting the contrary, like credible forecasts of sunshine**, **If the proposition "it is raining" were false given the misleading evidence, the person might continue to believe it**, **Under the sensitivity condition alone, this belief would not qualify as knowledge despite being true and justified**
