## Content

**There is a plausible principle that awareness of the reliability of one's cognitive processes contributes to knowledge. This principle together with unfamiliar reliable processes implies that lack of awareness challenges the sufficiency of reliability.**, **Consider a case where a person holds a true belief produced by a cognitive process known to be reliable to an external observer but unknown to the person. Intuitively, we might say the person lacks knowledge because they are unaware of this reliability.**
