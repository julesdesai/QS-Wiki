## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, through sheer luck, holds a stable belief that aligns with a true proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that this should not be considered knowledge.**, **Knowledge generally requires a stronger connection to truth than mere accidental alignment, thus posing a challenge to stability as sufficient for knowledge.**
