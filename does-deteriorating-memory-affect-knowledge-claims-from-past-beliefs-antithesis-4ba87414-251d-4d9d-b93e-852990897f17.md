## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an elderly person remembers a fact from long ago, but their overall memory capability is deteriorating. Intuitively, we might judge that the frailty of their memory capacity questions their current knowledge despite accurate retention of this one fact.**, **A principle could be that reliable memory capacity is important for maintaining knowledge over time. This principle, combined with natural aging effects on memory, raises doubts about the sufficiency of past knowledge retention for current knowledge.**, **Deteriorating memory challenges the claim that past knowledge, accurate and retained, is sufficient for current knowledge assertion.**
