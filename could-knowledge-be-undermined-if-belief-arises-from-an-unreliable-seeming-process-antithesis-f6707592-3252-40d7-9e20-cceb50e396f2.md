## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition and knows that the source of their belief is typically unreliable, but the belief is true by chance. Intuitively, one might conclude that the person lacks knowledge because the process seems unreliable.**, **It is implausible that true belief founded on a process that seems unreliable, even if accidentally reliable, should qualify as knowledge due to the typical expectation that knowledge stems from trustworthy processes.**
