## Content

**There are cases where practical engagement with a domain grants individuals knowledge without them ever forming traditional beliefs about specific propositions, such as a navigational expert who knows how to chart courses without verbally articulated beliefs about latitudinal lines.**, **This challenges the idea that belief, which often requires articulation, is necessary for knowledge, as practical know-how can exhibit all other hallmarks of knowledge.**
