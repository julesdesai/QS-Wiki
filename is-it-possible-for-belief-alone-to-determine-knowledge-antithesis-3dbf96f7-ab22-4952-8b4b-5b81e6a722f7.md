**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition, then their belief in that proposition must not be based solely on another person's testimony without further justification.**, **Consider a case where a person believes a proposition solely because an authority figure told them it is true, and the proposition is true. Intuitively, we would not judge that they know the proposition.**
