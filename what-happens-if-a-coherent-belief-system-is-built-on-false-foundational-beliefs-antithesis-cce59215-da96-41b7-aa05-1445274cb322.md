## Content

**Consider a belief system coherently constructed around a central, false assumptionâ€”such as that the Earth is at the universe's center.**, **All derived beliefs remain coherent with this false center, supported by misinterpreted observations.**, **Intuitively, it is hard to attribute genuine knowledge to beliefs stemming from falsehoods, despite coherence.**
