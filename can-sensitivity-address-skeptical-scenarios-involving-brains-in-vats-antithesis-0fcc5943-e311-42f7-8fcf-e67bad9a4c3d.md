## Content

**Suppose a person confidently believes they are at home, but they consider the skeptical scenario that theyâ€™re actually a brain in a vat extensively stimulated to think they are at home.**, **If it were false that they are at home, due to being in a vat, they would still possess the belief that they are at home.**, **Even though sensitivity fails here, intuitive knowledge seems intact; they daily engage with their environment aptly, assuming normal circumstances.**
