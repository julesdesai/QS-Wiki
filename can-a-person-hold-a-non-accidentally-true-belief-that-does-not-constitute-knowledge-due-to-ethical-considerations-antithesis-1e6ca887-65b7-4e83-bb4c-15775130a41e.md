## Content

**Consider a person who learns a true proposition through unethical means such as eavesdropping or deceit. The belief is true and discovered in a non-accidental way, yet intuitively we might resist calling this knowledge due to the unethical method of acquisition.**, **There is a plausible principle that ethical considerations factor into what constitutes knowledge. This principle suggests that knowledge should be ethically obtained, indicating that non-accidental truth is not solely sufficient for knowledge.**
