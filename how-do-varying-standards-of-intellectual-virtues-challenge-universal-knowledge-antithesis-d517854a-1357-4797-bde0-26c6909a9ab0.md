## Content

**A plausible principle states that intellectual virtues are standards which should be universally applicable. Varying interpretations of virtues like curiosity challenge the universality of knowledge derived through them.**, **Consider scenarios where intellectual virtues are defined differently across cultures or disciplines. These variations intuitively disrupt a common epistemic foundation required for universal knowledge claims.**
