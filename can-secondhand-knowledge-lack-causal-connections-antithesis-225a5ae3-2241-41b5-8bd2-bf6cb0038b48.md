## Content

**Suppose Morgan learns from a reliable news source that a distant event occurred, and it did. Though Morgan believes truly and justifiably, there's no direct causal link to the event, only possibly to the intermediary source. Intuitively, Morgan still knows about the event.**, **This suggests that secondhand knowledge might not require the same kind of causal connection as firsthand knowledge does.**
