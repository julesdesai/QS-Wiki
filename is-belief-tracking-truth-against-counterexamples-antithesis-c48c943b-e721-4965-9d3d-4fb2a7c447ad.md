## Content

**Consider a case in which a person has a belief that a specific stock will rise due to insider information, but across many variations of the possible worlds, the stock rises purely because of unrelated market factors. Intuitively, we would judge that their belief is tracked correctly but not due to the reasons they hold.**, **It is implausible that tracking disconnected from the reasons for the belief aligns consistently with knowledge, as understanding causality is weakened.**
