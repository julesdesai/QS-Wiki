## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is formed in what seems like the right epistemic context, but the person acquired this belief through unreliable means, like astrological predictions. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable methods of belief formation are necessary for true knowledge, even when all sufficiency conditions are met.**
