## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief based on a reliable but non-virtuous method such as a highly accurate computer. Intuitively, we would judge that the person possesses knowledge in this case.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not require the exercise of intellectual character traits. This principle together with the fact that the belief is reliably formed entails that the belief constitutes knowledge.**
