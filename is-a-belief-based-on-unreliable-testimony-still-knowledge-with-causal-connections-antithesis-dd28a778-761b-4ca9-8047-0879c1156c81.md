## Content

**In a case where a person believes a true proposition based on the testimony of a known liar, the causal connection via testimony seems inadequate for knowledge. Intuitively, this belief doesn't constitute knowledge even if the belief is true.**, **Testimonial evidence can sometimes be insufficient for knowledge if the source lacks reliability, despite the causal link.**
