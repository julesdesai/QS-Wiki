## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a complex mathematical proof through steps that are not self-evident. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the conclusion.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge of complex truths can be built from inferential steps that are themselves not self-evident nor incorrigible. This principle, together with the case, suggests that foundationalism might exclude some true instances of knowledge.**
