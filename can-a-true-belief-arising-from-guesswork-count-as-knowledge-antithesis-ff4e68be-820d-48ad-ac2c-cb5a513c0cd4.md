## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person makes a guess that happens to be true. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A true belief that arises from sheer guesswork, rather than from a method or process exhibiting epistemic virtue, does not seem to constitute knowledge.**, **A belief resulting from a process lacking epistemic virtue, even if true, cannot amount to knowledge if we intuitively reject the role of luck in knowledge.**
