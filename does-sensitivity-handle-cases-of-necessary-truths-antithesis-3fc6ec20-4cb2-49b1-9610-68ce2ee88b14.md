## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a necessary truth, like a mathematical fact, and acquires this belief through proper justification. In such a case, the belief will be true and believed regardless of any counterfactual situation. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the necessary truth.**, **A necessary truth is one that would be true in all possible worlds, hence a person believing a necessary truth cannot satisfy the sensitivity condition since the proposition could never be false.**
