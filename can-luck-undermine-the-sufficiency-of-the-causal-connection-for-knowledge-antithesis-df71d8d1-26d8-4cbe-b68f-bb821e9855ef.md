## Content

**Consider a case in which a person forms a true belief through sheer luck, as in finding a lost item by randomly walking in the right direction, with no causal connection to the possession of knowledge. Intuitively, this seems less like knowledge and more like chance.**, **It is implausible that luck, without a relevant causal mechanism, fulfills the criteria for knowledge as sufficiency requires more than just coincidence.**
