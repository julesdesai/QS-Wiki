## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes Fermat's Last Theorem before it was proven, feeling intuitively that it is true. The intuition is that they know it because mathematical truths are necessarily true.**, **A plausible principle is that sensitivity requires believing only true propositions in all possible worlds. However, this becomes redundant in the context of mathematical truths as they are true in all worlds by definition.**, **It is implausible that sensitivity adds any explanatory value for mathematical knowledge, since belief in necessary truths does not render one sensitive to their truth because their false counterfactuals do not exist.**
