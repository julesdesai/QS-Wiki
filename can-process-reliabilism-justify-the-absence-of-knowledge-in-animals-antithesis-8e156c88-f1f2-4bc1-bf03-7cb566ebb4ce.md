## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a dog anticipates food at a certain time due to the reliable daily pattern of feedings. Intuitively, we either have to say that the dog possesses knowledge about feeding time or that reliable expectations do not result in knowledge. If we say it is knowledge, we must attribute knowledge to animals in basic predictive behaviors. If we say it is not, reliable processes alone do not suffice for knowledge.**
