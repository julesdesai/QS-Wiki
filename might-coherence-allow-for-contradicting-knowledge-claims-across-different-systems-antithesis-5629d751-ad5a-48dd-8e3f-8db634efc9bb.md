# Might coherence allow for contradicting knowledge claims across different systems?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 5629d751-ad5a-48dd-8e3f-8db634efc9bb
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Coherentism](knowledge-as-coherentism-synthesis-85766c18-a792-401a-afc4-7bb19b4ddeb2.md)

## Content

**There is a plausible principle that two distinct coherent systems can each justify incompatible propositions. This principle together with the claim that coherence suffices for knowledge entails that two individuals could both know contradictory claims, which is implausible.**
