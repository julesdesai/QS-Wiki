## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which Dan and Eve both use similar reasoning to arrive at a belief, but in nearby worlds Dan's belief remains true while Eve's does not due to subtle differences beyond their control. Intuitively, we either have to say both beliefs are equally knowledgeable or one is not. If we attribute knowledge differently, safety diverges from consistent epistemic evaluation.**
