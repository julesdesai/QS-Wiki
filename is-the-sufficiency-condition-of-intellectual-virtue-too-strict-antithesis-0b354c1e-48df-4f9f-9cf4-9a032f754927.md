## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual forms a true belief because of a reliable process, such as eyesight, and not due to an exercise of intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we would say the person knows what they see. This challenge asserts sufficiency is too strict if it excludes knowledge from reliable processes.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliable epistemic processes can suffice for knowledge without invoking intellectual virtue. This principle questions the view that intellectual virtue alone can sufficiently account for knowledge.**
