## Content

**Consider a case where a person sees a barn in an area full of fake barns; they correctly identify a real barn due to the reliable, perceptual process without knowing the prevalence of fakes. Intuitively, this seems not to genuinely constitute knowledge.**, **Knowledge might require an awareness of potential misleading factors, which reliable processes alone do not address.**
