## Content

**There is a plausible principle that some foundational beliefs, such as immediate sensory experiences, are necessary for knowledge and not just coherence. If coherence neglects these elements, it might not suffice for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where sensory experiences contradict a person's coherent belief system due to a hallucination. Intuitively, we would judge that relying purely on coherence might misguide the individual away from knowledge.**
