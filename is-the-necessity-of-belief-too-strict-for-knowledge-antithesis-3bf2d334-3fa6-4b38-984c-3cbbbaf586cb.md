## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person is presented with overwhelming evidence for a proposition but remains undecided and does not believe the proposition. Intuitively, despite lacking belief, they seem to possess a form of understanding that approximates knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge involves some mental state conceptually different from belief that captures a person's grasp of evidence. This principle together with the necessity of belief in knowledge suggests belief might be too narrow a requirement.**, **Belief necessity fails to account for cases of profound evidential recognition without full belief commitment.**
