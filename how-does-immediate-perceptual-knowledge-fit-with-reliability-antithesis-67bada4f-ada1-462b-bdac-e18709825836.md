## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a perceptual belief about a nearby object that is true and belief is formed immediately without a process deemed as reliably verified. Intuitively, we would judge the person has knowledge, but it challenges the requirement of an identifiable reliable process.**, **There is a plausible principle that acknowledges immediate perceptual knowledge, suggesting knowledge doesn't always require process reliability verification if the belief is clearly true.**
