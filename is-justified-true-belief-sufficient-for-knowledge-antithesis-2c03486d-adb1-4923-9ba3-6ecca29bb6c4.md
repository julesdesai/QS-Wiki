## Content

**A case in which some person P believes that it is noon, their watch reads that it is noon, and it is in fact true that it is noon is a case in which P has justification for their belief**, **In the scenario where the watch is broken and happened to stop at noon, intuitively, P does not have knowledge that it is noon**, **If it was sufficient for P to have a justified true belief to have knowledge, then P would have knowledge in this case, which is counterintuitive**
