## Content

**Consider a person who knows "I have a hand" and knows that "If I have a hand, then I am not a brain in a vat being deceived." Intuitively, they should also know "I am not a brain in a vat."**, **If sensitivity fails to extend across known implications, intuitive judgments about knowledge seem unsupported, undermining the cohesion of beliefs considered known.**
