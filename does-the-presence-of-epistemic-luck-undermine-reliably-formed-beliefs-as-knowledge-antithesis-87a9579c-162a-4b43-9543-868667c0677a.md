**Consider a scenario where a person believes a clock reads 3 PM because it is functioning reliably and the belief is true.**, **In such a case, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge if it turns out the clock stopped working exactly 24 hours ago, and the current time coincidentally is 3 PM.**
