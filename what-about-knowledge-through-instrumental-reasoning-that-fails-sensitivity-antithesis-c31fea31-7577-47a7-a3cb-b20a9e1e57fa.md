**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** c31fea31-7577-47a7-a3cb-b20a9e1e57fa
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge as Sensitivity](knowledge-as-sensitivity-synthesis-8137b3ae-12a3-4180-b386-022b04bc2988.md)

## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person uses an instrument to determine a proposition, and their belief based on this is true, but they would believe it even in nearby false conditions due to an instrument fault. Intuitively, we might still consider this as knowledge.**
