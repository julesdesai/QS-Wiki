## Content

**Consider a scientist who justifies a belief with current data, but as new data emerges rapidly, previous justifications become outdated. Intuitively, keeping up with rapid changes may make knowledge appear unstable.**, **If rapid changes in defeasible justification cause knowledge to become frequently outdated, then the reliance on defeasibility alone creates challenges in holding persistent knowledge.**
