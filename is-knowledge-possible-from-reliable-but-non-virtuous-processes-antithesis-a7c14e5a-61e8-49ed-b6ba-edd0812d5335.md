## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person develops a true belief through a reliable but mundane process that lacks intellectual virtue. Intuitively, this belief could still be regarded as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliability, not virtue, is central to ascribing knowledge. If reliable processes lacking virtue yield true beliefs, the necessity of intellectual virtue for knowledge is questioned.**
