## Content

**Suppose we have a lottery in which the probability of any ticket winning is extremely low, leading people to believe that any given ticket will lose. Intuitively, we have to say these beliefs are justified and true if any given ticket they hold does lose, or accept a skepticism about such everyday beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that beliefs formed on a sufficiently strong statistical basis constitute knowledge. The sensitivity condition implies such beliefs cannot constitute knowledge, because if the ticket did win, beliefs based on the same principle would still affirm it would lose.**
