## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief is true in a stable environment but becomes false with slight changes. Intuitively, we might still hold the belief counts as knowledge in the stable context.**, **Sensitivity requires beliefs to track truth in changing scenarios, potentially discrediting knowledge claims due to shifts in environment. Intuitively, such changes do not always undermine knowledge.**, **It is implausible to claim a loss of knowledge purely due to environmental changes that are irrelevant to the belief's core justification.**
