## Content

**It is implausible that reliance on intellectual virtues can avoid circular reasoning, as what constitutes an "intellectual virtue" might itself require validation by knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which intellectual virtues are defined by their contribution to knowledge. Intuitively, we either have to say that the virtues presuppose knowledge or that knowledge presupposes the virtues. If we say that the virtues presuppose knowledge, then a circularity arises; if we say knowledge presupposes virtues, we risk infinite regress.**
