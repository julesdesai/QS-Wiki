## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person consults an expert source that is generally reliable but momentarily compromised due to a transient disruption, like a brief network failure that misrepresents the data. Intuitively, even if they form a true belief from the distorted data, it is questionable whether they actually achieve knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that temporary external distortions to reliability should not necessarily discount knowledge if rectified, suggesting that the reliability condition may require reevaluation in dynamic contexts.**
