## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition that is true, but the cognitive faculties that produced the belief are malfunctioning. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A belief formed through malfunctioning cognitive faculties can still be true and believed by the person. In such cases, the absence of properly functioning faculties seems to disqualify the belief as knowledge.**
