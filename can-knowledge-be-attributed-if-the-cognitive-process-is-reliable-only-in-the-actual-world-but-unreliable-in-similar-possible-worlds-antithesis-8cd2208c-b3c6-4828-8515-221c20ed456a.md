## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief about the result of a sports match through a cognitive process that relies on a radio station frequently providing accurate scores, but in most nearby worlds, the station often provides inaccurate scores due to faulty equipment. Intuitively, we would question if the belief formed in the actual world counts as knowledge.**, **For a belief to qualify as knowledge, it should be formed by a cognitive process that is reliable not only in the actual world but also in most relevant possible worlds.**
