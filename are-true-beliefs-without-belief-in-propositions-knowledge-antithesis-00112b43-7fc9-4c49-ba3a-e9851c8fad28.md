## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Dana, acts on what is effectively a true proposition without explicit belief in it, due to implicit understanding or intuition. Intuitively, she seems to possess knowledge despite the absence of explicit belief.**, **The necessity of belief in a proposition is contradicted by cases where implicit knowledge guides decision-making even when one lacks explicit belief.**, **The condition that explicit belief is necessary for knowledge might dismiss knowledge that guides actions intuitively or unconsciously.**
