## Content

**Suppose a person attempts to use their cognitive faculties in an environment that significantly disrupts their normal operations, leading to a true belief by accident. Intuitively, the inappropriate environment implies that the person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be compromised by environmental factors, indicating that proper cognitive function alone is insufficient for knowledge if the environment distorts belief formation.**
