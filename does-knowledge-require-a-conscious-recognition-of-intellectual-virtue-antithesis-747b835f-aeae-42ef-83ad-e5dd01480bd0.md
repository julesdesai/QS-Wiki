## Content

**It is implausible that possessing knowledge necessitates awareness or recognition of the exact intellectual virtue at play, as individuals often possess knowledge without reflecting on their cognitive processes.**, **Suppose we have a case where someone knows a fact yet cannot articulate or identify the intellectual virtue leading to that knowledge. This implies knowledge does not demand conscious recognition of intellectual virtues.**
