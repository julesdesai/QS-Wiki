## Content

**Suppose we have a case where an intellectually virtuous inquiry leads to a well-supported yet false belief due to unknown variables, such as early scientific theories about the cosmos. Intuitively, we might value the intellect involved despite the false conclusion.**, **It is implausible to discount the intellectual virtue just because the belief was not true. This casts doubt on truth as a necessary condition when assessing intellectual virtue.**
