## Content

**Consider a situation where a person justifiably believes a true proposition based on strong evidence, but external interference alters the context, making the evidence seem less reliable. Intuitively, before the interference, they have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge is context-dependent and should not retroactively be invalidated by unforeseen external changes.**, **It is implausible that external factors should retrospectively negate knowledge that was adequately grounded in justified belief at its inception.**
