## Content

**Suppose a person knows their own name. Intuitively, if this knowledge required an infinite justification chain, it seems implausible that anyone could actually possess such knowledge.**, **It is implausible that common and widely agreed upon knowledge, such as knowing one's own name, is grounded in an infinite series of justification.**
