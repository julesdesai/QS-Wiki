## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a tourist in a foreign country reads a sign but doesn't understand the local language, thus misinterpreting the sign's meaning. Intuitively, we would judge that the tourist lacks the necessary local context to justify a belief about the sign's meaning.**, **There is a plausible principle that local or context-specific factors can affect whether one's belief meets justification standards.**
