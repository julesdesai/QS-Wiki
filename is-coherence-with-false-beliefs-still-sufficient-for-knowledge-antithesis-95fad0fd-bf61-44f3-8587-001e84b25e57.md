## Content

**A belief can cohere with a coherent system of beliefs that, at its core, contains one or more false foundational beliefs.**, **In such a belief system, false foundational beliefs might lead to systematic errors even though coherence is maintained.**, **If coherence can incorporate false foundational beliefs yet remain comprehensive, it may not guarantee the truth required for knowledge.**
