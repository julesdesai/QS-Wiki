## Content

**Consider a skeptical scenario where a person doubts whether any belief system, no matter how coherent, can rise to the level of knowledge. Intuitively, skepticism about all beliefs challenges knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must overcome skeptical challenges. This principle together with skepticism's staying force questions coherence's adequacy in resolving skepticism.**
