## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone knows a historical fact based solely on childhood memories, but the historical verification is lost. Intuitively, one may question whether the belief and truth conditions alone suffice without modern verification.**, **It is implausible that justification suffices contextually if non-verifiable memories serve as its basis, undermining the necessary independent verification for knowledge.**
