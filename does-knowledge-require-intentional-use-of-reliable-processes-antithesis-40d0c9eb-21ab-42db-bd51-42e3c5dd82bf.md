## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person unknowingly ingests a truth-serum, which reliably causes them to express only true beliefs. Intuitively, we would question whether any resulting true beliefs constitute knowledge. In this case, if the person was unaware of ingesting the serum and did not intentionally engage a reliable cognitive process, it seems unintuitive to attribute knowledge to them.**
