## Content

**Consider a person who once had a coherent belief system that now lacks coherence due to changes in context or belief. Intuitively, we would judge they can no longer claim knowledge of particular propositions.**, **Knowledge should not rely on past coherence if current beliefs are incoherent, suggesting that ongoing coherence is necessary rather than merely past coherence.**
