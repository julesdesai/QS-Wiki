## Content

**A case in which some person walks into a room full of indistinguishable fake barns and correctly identifies the one real barn they saw earlier. In this case, they believe the real barn is present safely because they've seen it before, but intuitively, the presence of fake barns means the belief could easily have been false.**, **A case where safe beliefs are formed in environments full of misleading or similar scenarios suggests intuitively that such beliefs may not constitute knowledge despite seeming safe.**
