## Content

**Suppose person A believes a true proposition based on a hunch, while person B believes the same proposition with strong evidence. Intuitively, person B seems to have better justification, yet both might be said to know the truth if the proposition is true.**, **If varying levels of justification can both result in knowledge, despite the strength or weakness of justification, then the sufficiency of defeasible justification for knowledge is questionable.**
