## Content

**There is a plausible principle that verification of a process's reliability cannot itself be dependent on the process. This principle suggests that reliabilism confronts a problem of circularity if the reliability of a process must be established by that same process.**, **Consider a scenario where one uses a memory process to establish its own reliability. Intuitively, we would doubt the justification of beliefs formed by a process that is verified through itself, challenging the independence necessary for establishing reliability.**
