## Content

**Suppose a person holds a true belief about a proposition based solely on practical benefits rather than evidence or rational justification. Intuitively, we might judge that without rational reasons, their true belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **If defeasibility requires ignoring practical reasons in the justification of beliefs, it might not adequately capture how people form beliefs in practical situations.**
