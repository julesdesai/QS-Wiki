## Content

**A safely formed belief is one that is unlikely to be false given the method of formation.**, **Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief based on a generally unreliable method or source, such as an extremely lucky guess or a typically inaccurate horoscope prediction.**, **Intuitively, it seems that such beliefs should not constitute knowledge, as their true nature is incidental rather than due to the method of formation.**
