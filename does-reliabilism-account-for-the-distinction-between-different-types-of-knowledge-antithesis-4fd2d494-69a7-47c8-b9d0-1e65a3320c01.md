## Content

**Consider that there are multiple types of knowledge, such as procedural knowledge and propositional knowledge. Intuitively, propositional knowledge requires a different justification process than procedural knowledge.**, **If different types of knowledge have different justificatory needs, then a single reliance on reliabilism may be insufficient to define all knowledge.**
