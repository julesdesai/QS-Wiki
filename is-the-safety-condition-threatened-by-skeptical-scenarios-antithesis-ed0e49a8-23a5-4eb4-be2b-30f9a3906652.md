## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a true belief but is in a situation perfectly indistinguishable from one in which their belief would be false, such as a brain-in-a-vat scenario. Intuitively, this challenges the idea that safety guarantees knowledge.**, **It is plausible that scenarios where beliefs are isolated from false alternatives because of deception challenge the link between safety and knowledge.**
