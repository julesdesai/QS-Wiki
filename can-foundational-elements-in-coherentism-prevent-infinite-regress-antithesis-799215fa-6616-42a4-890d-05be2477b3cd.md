## Content

**There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs are stopping points that prevent infinite regress in justifying knowledge. This principle together with the need for coherence suggests that foundational beliefs must inherently justify themselves or draw justification.**, **It is implausible that foundational beliefs can both be self-justifying and also coherently integrate into an interconnected web without deriving further support beyond their foundational nature.**
