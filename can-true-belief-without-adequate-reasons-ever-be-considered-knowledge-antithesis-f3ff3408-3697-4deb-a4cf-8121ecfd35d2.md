## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition solely on the basis of a lucky guess, and the proposition is true. Intuitively, we would not say that the person knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just true belief. This principle, together with the view that belief alone does not constitute knowledge, entails that adequate reasons must be present for knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition without any rationale or evidence, but only by coincidence. Intuitively, we have to say that this is not a case of knowledge, hence mere true belief cannot suffice for knowledge without adequate reasons.**
