## Content

**Consider a belief system that is internally coherent and includes an anti-skeptical guarantee but lacks empirical support; intuitively, we sense a gap between such coherence and actual knowledge.**, **It is implausible that theoretical coherence alone, without empirical backing, can generate knowledge.**
