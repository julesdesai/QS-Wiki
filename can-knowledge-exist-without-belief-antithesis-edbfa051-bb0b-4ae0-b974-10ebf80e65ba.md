## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person acts in every way as if they know a proposition and can reliably bring about success in relevant activities, but they do not consciously hold the belief in the proposition. Intuitively, this could still be considered a case of knowledge, even though the person lacks belief.**, **It is implausible that knowing a proposition necessarily involves believing it, if a person can demonstrate knowledge without explicit belief.**
