## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief that turns out to be true based on pure chance, such as guessing correctly. Intuitively, we would judge that despite the correctness, the person does not truly know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that for belief to count as knowledge, it must not only be true but must also reliably derive from factors beyond mere chance. Chance lacks the reliability needed for knowledge. This principle together with true beliefs formed by sheer luck entails they cannot be considered knowledge.**
