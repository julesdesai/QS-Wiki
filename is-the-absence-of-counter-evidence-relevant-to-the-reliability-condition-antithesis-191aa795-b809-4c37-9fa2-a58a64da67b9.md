## Content

**Consider scenarios where a person forms a belief about a proposition without counter-evidence, relying on processes historically yielding true propositions, and the belief is correct. Intuitively, we would judge that absent evidence does not necessarily enhance the reliability nor constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires actively excluding reasons that would undermine belief, beyond just absence. Reliable processes without comprehensive evidence overlook the depth needed for constituting knowledge.**
