## Content

**It is implausible that contextualism avoids skepticism if it admits too much variability in justification standards. Consider a scenario where frequent changes in context lead individuals to constantly question whether they genuinely know anything at all.**, **Suppose a belief is justified in one context but not another. Intuitively, this suggests that knowledge could be too elusive and subject to frequent doubt.**
