## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for a belief to constitute knowledge, it must be objectively true.**, **Introspective access to justification can vary between individuals and may reflect subjective perspectives rather than an objective truth.**, **Consider a scenario where two individuals introspectively justify opposing beliefs based on different subjective experiences. Intuitively, both cannot have knowledge if their beliefs contradict each other, yet internalism suggests both can be justified.**
