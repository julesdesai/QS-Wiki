## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through intellectual virtue, the belief happens to be true, but the truth of the belief is due to an accident or coincidence unrelated to the virtue. Intuitively, we might judge that this case does not result in genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that if the truth of a belief is entirely accidental, then belief formed through intellectual virtue is insufficient for knowledge.**
