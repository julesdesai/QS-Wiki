## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person acquires a true belief through reliable cognitive faculties, yet does so without awareness of how those faculties are functioning. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or not. If we say the person knows the proposition, then we suggest that awareness of cognitive functioning is not necessary for epistemic virtues. If we say the person does not know the proposition, we imply that reliable faculties alone are insufficient without recognition of their functioning.**
