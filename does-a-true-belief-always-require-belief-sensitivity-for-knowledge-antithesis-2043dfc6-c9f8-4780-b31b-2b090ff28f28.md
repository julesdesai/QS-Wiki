## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief about the time based on a broken clock that coincidentally shows the correct time. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the person lacks knowledge even though the belief is true.**, **In scenarios where the relevant belief failures are due to coincidence or luck, intuitively, the sensitivity condition does not seem to capture the essence of knowledge.**
