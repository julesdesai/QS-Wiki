## Content

**Consider a situation where a skilled mathematician reaches a correct conclusion through intuition without being able to consciously explain the steps. The conclusion seems to be knowledge despite the lack of awareness of its justification.**,
**There is a plausible argument that intuition can act as a form of immediate justification. If intuition can provide justification, the necessity of conscious awareness is undermined.**
