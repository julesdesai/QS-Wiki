## Content

**Reliability focuses on the consistent formation of true beliefs over time, but one might intuitively judge that reliable processes lead to knowledge even if sensitivity is not strictly satisfied, as reliable belief formation counters logical inconsistencies in scenarios when the belief is false.**, **In examining cognitive processes, reliable mechanisms producing truth should indicate knowledge, despite potential failings to meet sensitivity in underserved hypotheticals.**
