## Content

**Suppose we have a system where beliefs are said to be based on intrinsically justified basic beliefs. Intuitively, we have to wonder if those basic beliefs themselves require justification for the system to avoid circularity.**, **It is implausible that a belief system grounded in basic beliefs can be non-circular without those beliefs also being independently justified.**
