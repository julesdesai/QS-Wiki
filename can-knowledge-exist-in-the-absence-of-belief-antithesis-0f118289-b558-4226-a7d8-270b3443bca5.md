## Content

**Imagine a case where an individual consistently acts in a way that demonstrates correct understanding, yet explicitly denies the belief due to a misarticulation or misunderstanding of the term 'belief'. Intuitively, we may still consider this as knowledge.**, **It is implausible to strictly require belief for knowledge when actions and outcomes clearly reflect understanding and knowledge in practice.**
