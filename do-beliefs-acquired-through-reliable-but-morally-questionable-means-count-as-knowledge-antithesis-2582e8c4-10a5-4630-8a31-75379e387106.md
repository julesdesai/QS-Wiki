## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is obtained accurately through surveillance, violating privacy norms. Intuitively, there may be moral hesitations about attributing knowledge to the belief despite it fulfilling reliability.**, **It is implausible that the reliability condition for knowledge ignores ethical dimensions, as moral objections may intuitively discount certain ways of obtaining beliefs as constituting knowledge.**
