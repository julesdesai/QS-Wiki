## Content

**Consider a scenario where environmental deception causes a reliable process to output a false belief, yet the process itself remains otherwise unchanged. Intuitively, we might judge the belief is not knowledge despite being formed by a typically reliable process.**, **There is a plausible principle that cognitive reliability should account for the possibility of deception; this principle suggests knowledge requires more than just statistical reliability.**
