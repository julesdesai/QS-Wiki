## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge implies an objective fact about the world, making it non-relative. This principle, together with the idea of context-driven justification, entails that knowledge could be subjective and relative to context.**, **Consider a scenario where two cultural groups, based on their contexts, have differing justifications for the same belief. Intuitively, this suggests knowledge could differ between groups, indicating epistemic relativism.**
