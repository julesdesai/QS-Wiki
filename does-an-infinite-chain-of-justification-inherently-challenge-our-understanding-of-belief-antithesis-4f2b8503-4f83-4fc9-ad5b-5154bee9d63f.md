## Content

**For belief to result in knowledge, it needs justifying reasons. An infinite chain suggests belief cannot be undergirded in full, thus undermining belief stability.**, **Suppose an individual is required to capture the full scope of an infinite sequence of reasons. Intuition suggests belief would be perpetually unstable, due to never-ending layers of justification.**, **It is plausible to say that infinite justified belief forms challenge the reliability and confidence that characterize genuine belief.**
