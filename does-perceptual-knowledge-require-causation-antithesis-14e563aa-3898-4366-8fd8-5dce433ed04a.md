## Content

**Consider a case in which a person accurately sees a bird through a clear glass window but does not realize the window is there. Intuitively, we judge that the person knows there is a bird, despite the fact that their belief is more directly about what they perceive rather than an item outside a causal chain.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge based on direct perception may not necessitate an explicit causal connection to the actual fact.**
