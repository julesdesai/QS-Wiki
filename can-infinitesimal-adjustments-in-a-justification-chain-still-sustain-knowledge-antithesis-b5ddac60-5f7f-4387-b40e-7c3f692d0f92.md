## Content

**Suppose a case in which the reasons for a belief form an infinite but infinitesimally varying series. Intuitively, slight differences in reasons don't alter the conclusion.**, **It is implausible that infinitesimally small adjustments in an endless chain have substantive impacts on the justification quality or on the claim to knowledge.**
