**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification involves an approximation of an infinite chain that is finite and accessible**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and there exists an approximated infinite chain that is finite and accessible as a justification**
