## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a deep-seated belief formed through years of experience but finds it difficult to articulate the justification when asked. However, this person's belief is both true and reliably formed. Intuitively, it seems they still possess knowledge.**, **The requirement for awareness might unfairly exclude cases of expertise or deeply ingrained knowledge where the person is unable to easily access or express the justification.**
