## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition due to faulty reasoning, but the proposition turns out to be true by coincidence. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not truly know the proposition, even though the other conditions are met.**, **If knowledge can be accidentally true, then the necessity of truth for belief to be knowledge is challenged.**
