## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, unknowingly a brain in a vat, believes they have hands because they can see and feel them. They have justification under their perceived context. However, if contextual standards are external and demanding, such as requiring one not be a brain in a vat to truly have knowledge, then intuitive conflicts arise due to differing contexts.**, **Reflection on skeptical scenarios, where one cannot eliminate extreme doubt, suggests that contextual justification may never truly satisfy strong evidential requirements for knowledge.**
