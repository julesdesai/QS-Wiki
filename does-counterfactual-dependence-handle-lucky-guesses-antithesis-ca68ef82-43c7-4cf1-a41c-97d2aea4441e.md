## Content

**Imagine a scenario where someone makes a lucky guess that happens to be true, and their belief could have been false if circumstances slightly changed. Intuitively, we do not consider this as knowledge.**, **A belief formed as a result of guessing is not typically seen as knowledge, even if the guess correlates counterfactually with the truth.**, **If luck maintains a role in forming true beliefs, counterfactual dependence on truth alone may not firmly establish knowledge.**
