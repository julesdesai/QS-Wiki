## Content

**A reliable process is often implicit and may not always be explicit or known to the believer when a true belief is retained. There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires at least implicit awareness or recognition of the process leading to one's belief.**, **Explicit awareness of reliability is rarely accessible to all knowers, suggesting a disconnect between being informed of a process's reliability and forming knowledge.**, **Implicit knowledge of processes suggests reliabilism may lack the explicitness needed in articulating how individuals engage with or validate these processes beyond mere outcome observation.**
