## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a belief turns out to be correct solely due to a random whim or sheer luck, albeit it coincides with the reliable prediction history of the believer. Intuitively, it seems one cannot claim knowledge in this case absent any cognitive rationale beyond happenstance.**, **The necessity for reliability is rendered questionable if and when beliefs arrive at truth independent from any cognitive processing.**
