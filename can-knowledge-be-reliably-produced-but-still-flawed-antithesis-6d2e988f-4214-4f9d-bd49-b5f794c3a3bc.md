## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition because of a generally reliable cognitive process that occasionally produces false beliefs. The process produces a true belief in this instance. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say the person has knowledge because the process is not infallible.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires certainty. If the process lacks certainty due to occasional errors, then its reliability may not suffice for knowledge.**
