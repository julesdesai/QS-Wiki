## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the reliability of a cognitive process in forming beliefs must be assessed according to a specific type under which the process falls. However, there is no clear criterion in reliabilism for determining which type is relevant. Intuitively, without being clear on which type of process to evaluate, claims about reliability lose their force.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person's belief is formed by a process classified in many ways, some reliable, others not. Without knowing which classification to use, it's unclear if the belief results from a reliable process.**
