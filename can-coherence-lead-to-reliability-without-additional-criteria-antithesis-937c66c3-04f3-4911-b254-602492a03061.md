## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a coherent set of beliefs that are not formed or maintained by reliable methods. Intuitively, we either have to say that reliability is not necessary for knowledge, or that coherence must be supplemented by reliability principles. If we say reliability is not necessary, then such belief systems prone to error would still qualify as knowledge. If we say coherence needs reliability, the initial definition claiming coherence suffices for knowledge is incomplete.**
