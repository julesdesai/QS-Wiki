## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Jamie, has a valid lottery ticket and believes it will not win because the odds are low. Intuitively, Jamie does not know the ticket will lose despite having a rational belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that if sensitivity to truth is required for knowledge, then Jamieâ€™s belief about the lottery ticket should be knowledge, but this conflicts with our intuition.**
