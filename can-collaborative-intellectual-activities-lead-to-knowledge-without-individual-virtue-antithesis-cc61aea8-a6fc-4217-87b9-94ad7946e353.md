## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a group of individuals collectively contribute to the formation of a true belief through a collaborative process rather than each individual's intellectual virtue. Intuitively, this could be considered as knowledge.**, **It is implausible that only individual intellectual virtues lead to knowledge when collective processes can result in justified true beliefs.**
