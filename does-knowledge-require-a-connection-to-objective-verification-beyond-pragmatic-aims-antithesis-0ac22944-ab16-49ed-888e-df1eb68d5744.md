## Content

**A person believes that a medicine is effective merely because people generally feel better after taking it, though this is due to a placebo effect rather than the medicine's efficacy. Intuitively, we would judge this as lacking true knowledge about the medicine's therapeutic value.**, **There is a reasonable principle that knowledge involves an objective verification of the truth, not just pragmatic efficacy or outcomes. This principle, alongside the view of practical truth, implies a missing link between belief and actual knowledge.**
