## Content

**If the justification for any known proposition must consist of an infinite, non-repeating sequence, the epistemic foundation constantly changes, introducing potential instability.**, **Consider a belief where justification relies on ongoing additions to the chain, leading to perpetual revision and uncertainty at any point in time.**, **Instability in justification questions the security and reliability traditionally associated with knowledge.**
