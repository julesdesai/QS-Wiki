## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, through a reliable process, forms a belief that is true due to an instance of epistemic luck, such that similar conditions usually lead to false beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge due to the role of luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that epistemic luck undermines knowledge. This principle along with the element of luck suggests that the belief should not be regarded as knowledge.**
