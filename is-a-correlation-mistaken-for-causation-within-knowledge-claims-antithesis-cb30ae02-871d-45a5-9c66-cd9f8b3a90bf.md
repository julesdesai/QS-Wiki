## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which two events regularly occur together, but not because one causes the other, such as the sunrise and rooster crowing. Intuitively, we cannot claim causal knowledge just due to correlation.**, **Identifying a correlation does not necessarily imply a causal connection, and mistaking correlation for causation can undermine claims of knowledge.**
