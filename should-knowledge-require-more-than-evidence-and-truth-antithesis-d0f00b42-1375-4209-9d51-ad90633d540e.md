**Consider a scenario in which a person reads a reliable weather forecast predicting rain and thus believes it. The belief is true and justified and may have no direct practical consequences if they remain indoors regardless of weather. Intuitively, one might still consider this knowledge, questioning the sufficiency of practical consequences.**, **It is implausible that practical consequences should be a necessary component of knowledge when strong evidence and truth already secure a propositionâ€™s validity.**
