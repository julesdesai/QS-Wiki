## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which beliefs are interconnected and coherent yet are based on a delusion shared among a group. Intuitively, we either have to say that the group's beliefs constitute knowledge or that they don't. If we say the group's coherent beliefs constitute knowledge, then false and delusional beliefs can be known, which contradicts the necessity of truth. If we say they don't, then coherence does not necessarily secure truth.**
