## Content

**Suppose we consider a mathematical truth, such as 2+2=4, known by people around the world. Intuitively, this truth doesn't seem to vary in accordance with contextual standards, thus it appears incompatible with contextualist views on justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that universal truths should be knowable in a context-independent manner; this principle seems at odds with the requirement that justification depends on context.**
