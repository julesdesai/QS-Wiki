## Content

**Suppose a person, D, has a belief that is accidentally true due to circumstances beyond their control, such as believing it will rain tomorrow based on a faulty weather app that coincidentally predicts the weather correctly. Intuitively, having a true belief that results from mere coincidence does not seem sufficient to constitute knowledge.**
