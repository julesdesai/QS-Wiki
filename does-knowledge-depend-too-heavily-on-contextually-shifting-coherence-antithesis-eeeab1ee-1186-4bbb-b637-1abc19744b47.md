## Content

**Consider the case where a person's belief coheres with a system of beliefs in one context but not in another due to varying logical considerations. It is implausible that what qualifies as knowledge can shift merely based on contextual coherence without any change in the underlying beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should remain stable across similar contexts, so the context-dependence of coherence in beliefs challenges the stability required for genuine knowledge.**
