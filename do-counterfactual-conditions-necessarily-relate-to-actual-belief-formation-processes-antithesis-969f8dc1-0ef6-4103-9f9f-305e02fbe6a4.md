## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a security system is reliable in preventing break-ins, but the value of that belief isnâ€™t tested as there are no break-ins. Intuitively, the reliability of the belief is about the future, not the present.**, **Counterfactual dependence does not always align with the reality of a belief formation process and can be irrelevant when a belief seems true.**
