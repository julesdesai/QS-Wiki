## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on evidence that accidentally acts in their favor, resulting in the belief cohering with their foundational beliefs purely by luck. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just a true belief that logically fits with one's other justified beliefs, ruling out accidental correctness.**
