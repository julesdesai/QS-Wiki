## Content

**There is a plausible principle that one's mental states should be sufficient for knowing a proposition. This principle suggests that if a person has access to all their relevant mental states, then that should be enough for knowledge.**, **The requirement that external factors such as the reliability of cognition are needed for justification conflicts with the principle that mental states alone should suffice for knowledge.**
