## Content

**It is implausible that context can serve as an objective determinant of justification standards because context is inherently subjective and variable**, **Two people in the same physical environment may perceive the context differently, leading to contradictory judgments about whether the justification standard is met**, **Suppose a person must meet a different level of justification for knowledge depending on who is observing them. It is counterintuitive that their actual knowledge state changes merely due to external observers**
