## Content

**A case involves a reliable process of forming beliefs based on expert testimony, which unknowingly originates from a misleading authority. In this situation, intuitively, the belief would not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that differentiating genuine expertise from misleading authority is crucial to knowledge attribution. This principle together with reliance on questionable authority entails that reliability, in this case, is not sufficient for knowledge.**
