## Content

**Consider a scenario where an intellectually virtuous person forms a belief based on misleading evidence that happens to be true. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not actually know the proposition, as their belief was formed through misleading evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief based on misleading evidence, even if resulting from intellectual virtue, should not be considered knowledge. This principle together with the condition of intellectual virtue entails that some true beliefs do not constitute knowledge.**
