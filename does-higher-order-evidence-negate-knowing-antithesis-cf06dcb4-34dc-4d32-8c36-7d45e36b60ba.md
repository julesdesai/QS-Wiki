## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person P believes a proposition and has evidence for it, but later encounters higher-order evidence suggesting their original evidence was flawed. Intuitively, we have to say that this higher-order evidence prevents P from knowing the proposition.**, **Higher-order evidence can undermine justification by revealing defects in one\'s initial evidential assessment.**, **The presence of higher-order evidence suggests that the fixed standard theory might be inadequate in dynamic evidential contexts.**
