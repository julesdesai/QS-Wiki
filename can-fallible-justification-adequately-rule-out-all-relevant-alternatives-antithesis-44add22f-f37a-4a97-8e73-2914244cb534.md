## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on fallible justification that cannot eliminate all alternative possibilities. Intuitively, one might judge that the person does not know the proposition because they fail to rule out possibilities that could be true instead.**, **The principle that knowledge requires considering and eliminating relevant alternatives conflicts with fallible justification's inability to do so.**
