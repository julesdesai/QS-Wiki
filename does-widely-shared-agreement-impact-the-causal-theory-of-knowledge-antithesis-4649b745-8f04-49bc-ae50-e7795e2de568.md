## Content

**Consider a community where everyone agrees that a certain scientific theory is true based on converging evidence and widespread consensus. In this scenario, while the community members did not personally verify each piece of evidence, intuitively, we would judge that they possess knowledge of the theory through social epistemic processes rather than direct causal relations to the specific evidence.**
