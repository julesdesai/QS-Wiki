## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition with strong justification, but someone adds false evidence against it that the person is unaware of. Intuitively, we would judge that the person's knowledge is compromised.**, **If we say the person still knows the proposition because they have no awareness of the defeater, it conflicts with our intuition about the role awareness of defeaters plays in knowledge.**
