## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition because they mishear the news on the radio and come to a conclusion that happens to be true. Intuitively, we would not consider this instance genuine knowledge because the belief stems from a misleading source, despite ultimately being true.**, **An appropriate causal connection is supposed to ensure the reliability and justification of a belief. However, in this case, the causal chain is unreliable, suggesting that the mere presence of a causal connection is insufficient for knowledge.**, **The concept of an 'appropriate' causal connection becomes problematic if inappropriate or misleading connections still result in true beliefs, suggesting that additional criteria may be needed.**
