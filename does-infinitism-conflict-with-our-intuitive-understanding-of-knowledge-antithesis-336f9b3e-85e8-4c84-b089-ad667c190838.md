## Content

**It seems implausible that everyday instances of knowledge require infinite justification, as we intuitively consider such knowledge to be valid based on finite evidence. Suppose a person believes it will rain because they see dark clouds and feel droplets. Intuitively, this seems sufficient for knowledge, yet infinitism implies such real-world knowledge is impossible without infinite justification, which conflicts with our intuitive understanding.**
