## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone believes that climate change will have disastrous effects in the next century, this belief is true, and it is justified by scientific evidence. Intuitively, we would say they know this proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that the future utility of knowledge does not diminish its current epistemic status. This principle, together with the claim that knowledge must have practical consequences now, implies an unnecessary restriction on what can be known.**, **It is implausible that the practical consequences of a belief must be immediate for knowledge to exist.**
