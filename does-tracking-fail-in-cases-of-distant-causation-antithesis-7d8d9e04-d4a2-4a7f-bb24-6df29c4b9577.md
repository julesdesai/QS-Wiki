## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes that a friend is at work, it is true, and the absence of their car in the driveway confirms it, but their belief does not sensitively react to the distant cause. Intuitively, this should not qualify as knowledge.**, **The belief about the friend's location is based on a causally distant indicator—missing car—that doesn't reliably track the friend's actual presence at work.**
