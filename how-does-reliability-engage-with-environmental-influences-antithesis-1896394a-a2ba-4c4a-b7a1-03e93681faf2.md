## Content

**Suppose a person forms beliefs through a reliable cognitive process in a benign environment, but the process would produce false beliefs in a radically different environment. This questions whether the person knows the proposition.**, **Reliability might depend upon stable environmental factors, suggesting that changes could disrupt the processâ€™s success.**, **Knowledge should not be contingent merely on environmental constancy but should demonstrate robustness to varying external conditions.**
