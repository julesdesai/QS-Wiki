## Content

**Suppose we have a belief that coheres perfectly with one's internal belief system, yet lacks empirical correspondence or experiential confirmation. Intuitively, we would hesitate to call such a belief knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence without empirical anchorage suffices for knowledge, suggesting limitations for asserting inferentialist coherentism.**
