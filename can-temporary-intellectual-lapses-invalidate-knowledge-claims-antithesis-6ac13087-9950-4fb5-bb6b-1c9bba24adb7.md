## Content

**Suppose a person typically exhibits intellectual virtues but momentarily suspends their critical thinking due to fatigue or distraction, yet still forms a true belief about a subject. Intuitively, if they achieve correct belief despite the lapse, we might question whether this momentary absence of virtue necessitates a loss of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that transient intellectual lapses can occur without undermining the bona fide acquisition of knowledge, challenging the necessity of consistent intellectual virtue in this claim.**
