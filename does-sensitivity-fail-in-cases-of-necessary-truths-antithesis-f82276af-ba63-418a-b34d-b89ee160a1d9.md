## Content

**Consider a proposition that is necessarily true, like a basic mathematical truth, where belief is insensitive to changes in scenarios. Intuitively, knowing such a truth should not require sensitivity to potential falsehood, as there is no possible scenario where the proposition is false.**, **A principle of sensitivity seems misapplied when it demands tracking truth in impossible scenarios.**, **It is implausible to deny knowledge of necessary truths based on a requirement that could never be satisfied due to the nature of these truths.**
