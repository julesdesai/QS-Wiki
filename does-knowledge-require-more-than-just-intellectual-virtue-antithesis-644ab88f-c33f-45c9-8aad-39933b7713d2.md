## Content

**Consider a scenario where a chess master makes a correct move out of habit rather than thoughtful consideration. Intuitively, while this might reflect their virtue in general, in this instance, the move isn't based on an exercise of virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that the exercise of intellectual virtue in the specific act of belief formation is required for knowledge. This principle entails that a habitual act, without active exercise of virtue, may fail to produce knowledge.**
