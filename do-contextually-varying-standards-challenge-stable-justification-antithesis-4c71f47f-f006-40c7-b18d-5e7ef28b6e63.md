**Suppose a person makes a claim that they know a particular scientific theory based on consensus within their field. In casual conversation, this might be accepted as knowledge.**, **Consider a formal academic setting where the claim is scrutinized under changing standards due to new evidence or arguments. The claim might no longer be seen as knowledge.**, **It is implausible that justification standards remain stable when knowledge claims face different expectations across contexts.**
