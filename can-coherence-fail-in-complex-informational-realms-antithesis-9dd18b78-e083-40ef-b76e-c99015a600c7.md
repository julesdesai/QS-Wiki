## Content

**Suppose an individual has a coherent belief system about a vast and complex domain such as quantum physics, but lacks understanding of foundational principles.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, there seems to be a gap in true knowledge despite coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that true understanding of complex information requires more than coherence; it requires grasping foundational knowledge.**
