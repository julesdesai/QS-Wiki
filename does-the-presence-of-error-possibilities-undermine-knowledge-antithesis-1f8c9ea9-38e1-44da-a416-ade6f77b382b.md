## Content

**Suppose we have a case where person P sees a barn in a countryside full of fake barn facades. Intuitively, P believes and perceives a real barn and has justification for it, making the belief true. However, due to the presence of fake barns, P does not know the barn is real despite having justification and true belief.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge is defeated by relevant error possibilities. This principle, along with P's situation, leads to the conclusion that P lacks knowledge even though belief, justification, and truth are present.**
