## Content

**Suppose a person uses a normally reliable watch to tell the time, which just happens to be malfunctioning without their knowledge, but by chance it displays the correct time. Intuitively, we might feel that the person does not actually know the time even though their belief is justified, true, and undefeatable.**, **There is an intuition that reliability of the justification process contributes to knowledge. This intuition challenges the idea that justified true belief with no defeaters is sufficient for knowledge.**
