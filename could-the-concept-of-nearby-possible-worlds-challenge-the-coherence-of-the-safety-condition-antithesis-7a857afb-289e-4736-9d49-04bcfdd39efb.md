## Content

**Suppose the conditions in nearby possible worlds shift rapidly, such as in chaotic systems where initial conditions significantly alter outcomes. Intuitively, what counts as a "nearby possible world" may become incoherent or insufficiently similar to evaluate safely.**, **The unpredictability of outcomes in such systems raises questions about whether the safety condition can always be meaningfully applied to determine knowledge.**
