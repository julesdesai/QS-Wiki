## Content

**Suppose a person claims to know a proposition and is required to provide justification through an infinite chain of reasons. Intuitively, one might judge that it is impractical for a person to have access to, or be able to grasp, an infinite chain of reasons.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be obtainable by human agents with finite cognitive capacities. This principle together with the requirement for an infinite chain of reasons suggests a practical limitation on acquiring knowledge.**
