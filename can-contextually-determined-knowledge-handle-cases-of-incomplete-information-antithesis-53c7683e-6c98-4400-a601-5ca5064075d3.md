**Consider a scenario where an individual holds a belief with contextually sufficient justification but lacks some information that could alter the context's appropriateness. Intuitively, we would judge this as not true knowledge.**, **Knowledge traditionally requires not merely contextually driven validation but also comprehensive, relevant evidence which context-alone might not ensure.**
