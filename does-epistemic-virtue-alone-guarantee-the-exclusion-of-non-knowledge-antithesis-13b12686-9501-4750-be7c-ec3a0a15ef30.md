## Content

**Consider a case where someone has an exercise of epistemic virtue but holds a belief in a true proposition only by coincidence, such as belief in a horoscope prediction that incidentally turns out to be true. Intuitively, this may not count as genuine knowledge despite the exercise of epistemic virtue.**, **It is implausible that all exercises of epistemic virtue necessarily result in knowledge.**
