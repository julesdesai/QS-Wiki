## Content

**Consider a case similar to the Gettier problem, where a person has a justified true belief based on misleading evidence, but the belief coheres with their system of beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, suggesting that coherence does not resolve Gettier-style cases.**
