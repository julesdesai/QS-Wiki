## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses a horoscope to believe they will have a good day and it turns out to be true. Intuitively, the belief does not track the truth because the method used is unreliable.**, **For a belief to track the truth, the method leading to that belief should be reliable and consistently connected to the truth, which is not the case with a faulty method.**
