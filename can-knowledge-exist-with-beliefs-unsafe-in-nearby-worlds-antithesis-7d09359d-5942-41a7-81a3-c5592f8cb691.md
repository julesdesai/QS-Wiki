## Content

**Suppose a person has a belief that is true but would be false in many nearby possible situations. In such cases, intuitively, we would hesitate to ascribe knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a degree of robustness against error across similar circumstances. This principle together with frequent false beliefs in nearby situations implies an absence of knowledge.**, **Unreliable truths in varying scenarios suggest that the safety condition is not always fulfilled, thus challenging the sufficiency of safety for knowledge.**
