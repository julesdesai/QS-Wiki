## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires stability not just in nearby possible worlds but also considering more distant possible worlds. If the truth value of a proposition frequently changes in other worlds that are not immediately nearby, intuitively, we would still challenge the claim that one knows it.**, **This principle together with the requirement for closeness of possible worlds in the Safety Theory may lead to a contradiction, as stability might not be present in those distant worlds.**
