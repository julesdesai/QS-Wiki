## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person's belief is true and justified due to stable external conditions, yet these conditions are generally unreliable and prone to change. Intuitively, it seems problematic to regard this as knowledge.**, **Consider the principle that knowledge requires, at least in part, reliable processes or methods. External stability that disregards overall reliability seems insufficient for knowledge.**
