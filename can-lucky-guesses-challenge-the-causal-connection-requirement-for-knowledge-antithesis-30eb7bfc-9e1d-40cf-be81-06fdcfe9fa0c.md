## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition due to a random guess, and the proposition turns out to be true with no causal connection to their belief. Intuitively, we would have to say that the person lacks knowledge despite the truth of the belief.**, **The notion of knowledge typically excludes cases of true beliefs that arise merely by luck.**
