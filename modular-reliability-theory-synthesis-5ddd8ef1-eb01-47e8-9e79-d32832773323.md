**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief arises from modular processes that are reliable in relevant contexts**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe a true proposition through a contextually reliable modular process**
