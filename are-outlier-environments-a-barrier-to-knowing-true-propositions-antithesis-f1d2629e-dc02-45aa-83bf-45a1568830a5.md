## Content

**Consider a situation where a person's cognitive faculties are properly functioning in an unusual environment, like outer space, and they form a true belief based on this. Intuitively, this belief could still be considered knowledge despite the atypical environment.**, **Being in an atypical environment while forming a true belief suggests limitations to environments deemed "appropriate," potentially excluding cases of knowledge that should be recognized.**
