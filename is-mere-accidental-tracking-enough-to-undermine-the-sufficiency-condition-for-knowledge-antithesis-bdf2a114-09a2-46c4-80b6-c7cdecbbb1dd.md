## Content

**It is implausible that a person knows a proposition if their belief only accidentally tracks the truth.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief about a proposition tracks the truth due to a coincidence. Intuitively, we have to say that the person does not know the proposition, even if the belief is true and they believe it.**
