## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition based on evidence from an unreliable source, which still, by chance, supports the truth. Intuitively, we would judge they lack knowledge because the source does not consistently produce true belief.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be based on evidence from sources that lack reliability, even if the belief turns out to be true.**
