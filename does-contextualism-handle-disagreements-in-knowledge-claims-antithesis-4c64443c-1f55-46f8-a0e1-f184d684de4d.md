**Consider a scenario where two people, in different contexts, make opposing claims about their knowledge of the same proposition.**, **If both are adhering to the knowledge standards of their respective contexts, they both claim to have knowledge.**, **The implication that both can know and not know at the same time in their context makes resolving disagreements problematic.**, **It is implausible for ordinary disagreements about knowledge claims to escape resolution due to contextual differences.**
