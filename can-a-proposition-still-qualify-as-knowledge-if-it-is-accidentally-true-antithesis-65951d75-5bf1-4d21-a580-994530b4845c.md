## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on faulty evidence, but the proposition is true by pure chance. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows the proposition.**, **A belief being true merely by accident, even if safe from error in nearby worlds, does not seem to constitute knowledge in an intuitive sense.**, **If a belief's truth being accidental excludes it from being knowledge, then safety alone cannot justify belief as knowledge.**
