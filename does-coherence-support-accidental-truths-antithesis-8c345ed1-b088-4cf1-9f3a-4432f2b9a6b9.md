## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's coherent beliefs lead them accidentally to a truth but for the wrong reasons.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know the proposition because the justification is merely accidental.**, **It is implausible to think that accidental truth justifications provide strong knowledge claims.**
