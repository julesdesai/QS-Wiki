## Content

**A case in which an expert has significant factual knowledge in a field primarily due to institutional training and adherence to protocol without exercising individual epistemic virtues challenges the sufficiency of epistemic virtues for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that detailed expert knowledge obtained largely through institutional structures and not personal epistemic virtue can still be genuine knowledge, even if the individual does not engage actively in virtuous inquiry.**
