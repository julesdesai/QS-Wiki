## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Alex, believes it will rain based on a weather forecast. It indeed rains, and Alex's belief was justified by the forecast. Intuitively, Alex knows it will rain, but the causal connection between Alex's belief and the actual rain may not be direct.**, **It seems implausible that all forms of knowledge must involve a direct causal link between belief and truth, as evidenced by cases like Alex's.**
