## Content

**Suppose a person is misled by a trickster but forms a true belief incidentally. Intuitively, the presence of deception makes it difficult to classify this as knowledge.**, **The requirement that a belief must arise from intellectual virtue implies engagement with truth straightforwardly. Belief formed through deception doesn't align with the intention of intellectual virtue, questioning its dominance in the account of knowledge.**
