## Content

**There is a plausible principle that reliable methods of belief formation are closely tied to knowledge. This principle, together with the notion that the safety condition alone may neglect non-reliable truth-conducive processes, challenges whether such a condition suffices without considering the reliability of the methods involved.**, **Consider a case where a person guesses correctly the answer to a complex math problem. Intuitively, we would judge they do not have knowledge, given the guesswork involved despite the proposition being true.**
