## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person named Mia believes a true proposition based on testimony from an unreliable source but happens to be correct. Intuitively, we might judge that Mia does not know the proposition, as the truth is incidental to the falsehood-prone source.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge depends on the reliability of the method used to acquire a belief. This principle, together with the reliance on unreliable testimony, entails that knowledge is not present if the belief comes from an unreliable source even if it is true.**
