## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition with justification and where the proposition is true, but there is undetected evidence that would undermine their justification. Intuitively, this undetected evidence undermines the reconciliation of belief and justification for the person to hold knowledge.**, **It is implausible that belief and justification alone can determine knowledge without consideration for undiscovered evidence or defeaters.**
