## Content

**Imagine a scenario where someone looks at a broken clock and beliefs the time it shows. However, the incorrect time happens to be the current actual time.**, **Even though the belief about the time is true, it seems implausible to say the person has knowledge because their reasoning process was flawed.**, **The intuition here is that true belief by accident rather than by reliable process doesn't constitute knowledge.**
