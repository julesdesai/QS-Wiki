## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief that it is raining based only on a hunch, yet it happens to be actually raining. Intuitively, this person does not have knowledge that it is raining.**, **There is a plausible principle that intuitive judgments about cases where beliefs are formed by unreliable processes cannot constitute knowledge. This principle, with the idea that reliable processes must lead to true beliefs, suggests that a coincidentally true belief from an unreliable process is not knowledge.**
