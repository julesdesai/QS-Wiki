## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition because they have a reliable source, yet there is a hidden defeater unknown to them such as an unreliable process that they unwittingly bypassed. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still does not know the proposition due to the hidden defeater's impact.**
