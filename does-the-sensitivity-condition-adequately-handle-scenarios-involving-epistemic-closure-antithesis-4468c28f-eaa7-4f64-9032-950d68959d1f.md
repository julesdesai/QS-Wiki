**Consider a scenario in which a person, Emily, knows she has hands. Knowing that hands are opposites of hooks would, via closure, also mean knowing she does not have hooks. However, in scenarios where imagining having hooks, her beliefs remain unchanged because she does not consider that possibility.**, **Closure under knowledge suggests that knowing one fact and knowing it entails another fact also implies knowing this second fact. The sensitivity condition cannot guarantee closure, facing difficulties with such entailments.**
