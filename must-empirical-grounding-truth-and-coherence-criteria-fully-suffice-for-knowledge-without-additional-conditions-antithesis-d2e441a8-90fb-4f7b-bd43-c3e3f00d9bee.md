## Content

**There is a plausible principle that empirical grounding, truth, and coherence provide a stable intellectual framework. This principle together with the possibility of error entails a potential gap in ensuring full knowledge.**, **Consider the case of a person who holds a belief with all required theoretical criteria met but is unable to account for unforeseen errors. Intuitively, this challenges the sufficiency claim.**
