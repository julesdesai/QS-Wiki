## Content

**There is a plausible principle that cognitive biases can distort the judgment undermining intellectual virtue or competence even when accidentally correct. This principle questions if true belief formed by accident when countered by bias counts as knowledge.**, **If biases are present, the conditions of competence or intellectual virtue might be deemed insufficient even with correct guessed outcomes, challenging if knowledge is genuinely possessed even if misunderstanding persists.**
