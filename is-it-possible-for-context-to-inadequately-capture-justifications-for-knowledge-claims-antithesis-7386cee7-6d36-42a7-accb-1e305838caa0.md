## Content

**Suppose we have a case where an employee claims to know that a report is accurate based on casual discussion among colleagues, where the justification standards are minimal. However, a formal review requiring higher justification standards finds the report to be flawed, calling into question the original knowledge claim.**, **It is implausible that context-dependent justification standards can consistently result in true knowledge claims. The variation in justification required can result in conflicting conclusions about what one knows, indicating potential inadequacies in context accounting for justification.**
