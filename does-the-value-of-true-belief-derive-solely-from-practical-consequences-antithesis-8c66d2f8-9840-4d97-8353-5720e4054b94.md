## Content

**There is a plausible principle that the value of true belief cannot be completely independent of its practical consequences. This principle together with the intuition that beliefs are valued for guiding action implies that practical utility contributes to the value of true belief.**, **It is implausible that a true belief about a mundane fact without any potential use is intrinsically valuable solely as knowledge.**
