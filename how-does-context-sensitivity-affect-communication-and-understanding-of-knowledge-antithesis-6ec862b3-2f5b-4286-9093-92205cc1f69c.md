## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person asserts "I know that it is the case" in a low-standard context to someone in a high-standard context. If the listener applies their own context's higher standards, they might interpret the statement as false or misleading.**, **If contextual sensitivity leads to such miscommunication, it challenges the usefulness of "knowledge" as a consistent term across conversations and discussions.**
