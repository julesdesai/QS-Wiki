## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Smith, believes that Jones owns a Ford based on strong evidence. Smith also reasons that either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona, without evidence for Brown's location. Remarkably, it turns out that Jones doesn't own a Ford, but by coincidence, Brown is indeed in Barcelona. Intuitively, Smith's belief in the disjunction being true lacks knowledge.**, **Intuitively, having justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge if the justification involves false premises.**
