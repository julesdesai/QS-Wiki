## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a true belief purely by luck, without knowledge of the belief's reliability.**, **Intuitively, such a case seems to lack the depth typically associated with knowledge, which involves understanding or awareness beyond the absence of defeaters.**, **It is implausible to consider true belief as knowledge when there is no awareness of what makes the belief reliable.**
