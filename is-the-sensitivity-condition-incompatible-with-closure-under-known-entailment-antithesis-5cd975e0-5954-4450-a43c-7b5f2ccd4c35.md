## Content

**Suppose Taylor knows the proposition 'I have hands' and believes it entails 'I am not a brain in a vat'. Intuitively, by knowing the first, Taylor should know the second.**, **It is implausible that sensitivity can satisfy closure under entailment, because Taylor might not be sensitive to the second, yet still knows the first.**
