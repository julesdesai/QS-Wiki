## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition through a process that is generally unreliable but happens to result in a true belief this time. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief must be consistently reliable to constitute knowledge. This principle together with the scenario entails that the belief in the scenario does not qualify as knowledge.**
