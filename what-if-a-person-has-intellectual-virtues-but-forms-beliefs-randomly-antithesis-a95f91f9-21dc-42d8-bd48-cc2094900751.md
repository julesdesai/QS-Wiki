## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person possesses intellectual virtues and abilities but forms a belief about a proposition randomly without employing these virtues. Intuitively, we would judge that despite having virtues, the person does not know the proposition if the virtues were not used**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge creation requires the active engagement of intellectual virtues at the moment of belief formation, rather than mere possession of virtues**
