## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people, in different contexts, believe the same proposition based on completely different sets of supporting beliefs that are coherent in their respective contexts. Intuitively, it seems implausible that both people can have knowledge simply because their beliefs are coherent relative to context-specific factors.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires some form of stability that transcends context. This principle together with the idea that coherence is entirely context-dependent entails that knowledge may lack such stability.**
