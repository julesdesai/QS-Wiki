## Content

**Suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob, both of whom observe the same coin flip event. Alice claims to know it landed heads in a casual setting, while Bob claims to know it landed tails in a rigorous scientific debate. Intuitively, if they have the same information, they should not be able to hold contradictory knowledge claims.**, **It is implausible that a consistent epistemic standard would allow for both heads and tails to be known simultaneously by two parties with equal evidence.**
