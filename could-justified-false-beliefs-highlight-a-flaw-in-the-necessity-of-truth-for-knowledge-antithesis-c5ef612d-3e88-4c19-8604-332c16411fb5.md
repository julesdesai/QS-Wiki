## Content

**Consider an instance where a person has a well-justified belief that nevertheless turns out to be false due to factors beyond their control. Intuitively, these situations challenge the notion that truth is necessary for someone to have known something in a given context.**, **The mere fact that a belief is false may not necessarily undermine the person's understanding or practical knowledge in particular domains.**
