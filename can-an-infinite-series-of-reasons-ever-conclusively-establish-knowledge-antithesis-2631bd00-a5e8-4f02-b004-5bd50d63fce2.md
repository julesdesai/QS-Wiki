## Content

**It is implausible that an infinite series can ever conclusively establish knowledge, as each reason in an infinite chain would itself require further justification ad infinitum. Suppose a person justifies believing a scientific fact by an infinite chain of studies. Each study being contingent upon the validity and truth of another makes it difficult to ever establish conclusive knowledge, as the chain never reaches a final grounding point.**
