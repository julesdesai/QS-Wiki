## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a belief leads to highly favorable pragmatic consequences but is based on poor evidence. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that pragmatic consequences alone should not count as a strong form of justification.**, **It is implausible that pragmatic consequences could outweigh epistemic reasons in cases where the evidence is weak or misleading.**
