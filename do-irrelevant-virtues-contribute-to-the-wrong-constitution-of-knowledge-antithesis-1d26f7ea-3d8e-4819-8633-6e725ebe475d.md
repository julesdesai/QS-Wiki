## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's true belief is anchored in an irrelevant intellectual virtue unrelated to the context of the proposition. Intuitively, the connection between virtue and truth in an unrelated context seems insufficient to constitute knowledge**, **There is a plausible principle that only those virtues relevant to a particular context can confer knowledge, challenging the view of virtue sufficiency without contextual relevance**
