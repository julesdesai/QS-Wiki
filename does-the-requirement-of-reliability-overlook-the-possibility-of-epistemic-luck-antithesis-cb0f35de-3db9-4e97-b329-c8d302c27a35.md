## Content

**A person correctly believes the outcome of a fair coin toss due to a reliable cognitive process predicting heads in 90% of cases. In such a case where the belief is true by luck, intuitively we would not consider it knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge excludes beliefs true merely by chance. This principle together with the presence of epistemic luck entails that a reliably-generated true belief is insufficient for knowledge.**
