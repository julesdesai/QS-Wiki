## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a proposition based on a well-reasoned argument drawn from several premises, one of which is accidentally false. Intuitively, we might judge that the person still knows the proposition if the false premise does not directly affect the truth of the conclusion.**, **There is an intuitive distinction between knowledge and mere belief where a person might have knowledge despite the accidental falsity of a minor premise, suggesting that the absence of false premises is not essential for knowledge.**
