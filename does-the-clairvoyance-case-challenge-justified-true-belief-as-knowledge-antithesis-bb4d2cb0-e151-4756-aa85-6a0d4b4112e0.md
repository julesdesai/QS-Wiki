## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a strong intuitive belief about a future event that turns out to be true, yet the belief was formed through a purported clairvoyant ability without normal justification. Intuitively, we either have to say that this person has knowledge or that they do not. If we say they have knowledge, then we deny the necessity of justification. If we say they do not have knowledge, then justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge.**
