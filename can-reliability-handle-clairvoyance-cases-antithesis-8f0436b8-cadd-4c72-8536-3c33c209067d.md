## Content

**Consider a person who, without any evidence or understanding, has a reliable clairvoyant ability to form true beliefs about presidential decisions. The person arrives at a true belief about a presidential decision based solely on a clairvoyant sensation. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, because they have no justification or understanding of how their belief is formed, despite its reliability.**, **Having a reliable process without intellectual justification or understanding might be insufficient for conferring knowledge.**
