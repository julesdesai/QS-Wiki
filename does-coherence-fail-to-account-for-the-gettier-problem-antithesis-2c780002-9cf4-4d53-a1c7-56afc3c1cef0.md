## Content

**Consider a case where someone has a belief that is true and justified through coherence, but the truth of the belief is due to luck. Such cases are analogous to Gettier problems. Intuitively, we would not say the person has knowledge.**, **A principle derived from the Gettier problem is that luck undermines the sufficiency of justification for knowledge. This casts doubt on the sufficiency of coherence for knowledge.**
