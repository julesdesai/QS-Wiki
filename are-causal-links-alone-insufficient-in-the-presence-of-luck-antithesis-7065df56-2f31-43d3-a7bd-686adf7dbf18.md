## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person comes to know the truth by pure luck despite a causal connection existing. In such a scenario, intuitively we may hesitate to say they 'know' given the significant role of luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests knowledge should exclude cases of luck. The involvement of luck in causally linked beliefs questions their sufficiency for true knowledge without excluding coincidental beliefs.**
