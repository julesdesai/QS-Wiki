## Content

**Suppose a person encounters evidence that appears to defeat their justification but is actually irrelevant due to a misinterpretation. Intuitively, it seems the person still knows the proposition if their belief is otherwise justified and true.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be undermined by mere appearances if they are incorrect. This principle together with the requirement for no defeaters entails that misinterpretation unfairly undermines knowledge.**
