# Is there a distinction between safety and sensitivity in knowledge?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 12e8b392-6fdd-464c-86e5-78f8c548fa19
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Safety Theory of Knowledge](safety-theory-of-knowledge-synthesis-bc9616ae-759a-4fba-a51e-fe6c4320cfc5.md)

## Content

**Safety implies that if a belief is true, it stays true in nearby worlds, but sensitivity suggests a belief would not be held if false. Intuitively, a belief can be safe but not sensitive, which seems to differentiate safety from a universal measure of knowledge.**, **The distinction between a safe belief being true in nearby worlds and sensitivity that it wouldn't be held if false questions whether safety alone suffices for knowledge.**
