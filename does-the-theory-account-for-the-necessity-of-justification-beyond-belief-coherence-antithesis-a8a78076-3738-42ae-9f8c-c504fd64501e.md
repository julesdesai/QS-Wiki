## Content

**Imagine a situation where beliefs cohere dynamically but lack traditional justification because the reasons behind them are unknown or mistaken. Intuitively, this seems inadequate for knowledge which traditionally necessitates justification.**, **It is implausible that coherence without justification can fully account for what knowledge requires.**
