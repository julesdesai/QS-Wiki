## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a basic belief that others inferentially build upon, but this basic belief is neither inferred from other beliefs nor tested against reality. Intuitively, such a basic belief lacks inferential support and seems problematic for claiming knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs should either be self-evident or inferentially justified. This principle, combined with the reliance on a possibly unsupported foundational belief, challenges the coherence approach if it grants knowledge status.**
