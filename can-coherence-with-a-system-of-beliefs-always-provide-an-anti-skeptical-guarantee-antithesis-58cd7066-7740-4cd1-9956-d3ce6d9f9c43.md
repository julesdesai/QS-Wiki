## Content

**It is implausible that coherence within a personâ€™s belief system can always provide an anti-skeptical guarantee because the beliefs could all be internally consistent but disconnected from reality.**, **Consider a system of beliefs generated by a computer simulation; intuitively, even if coherent, it might not guarantee the truth of external propositions.**
