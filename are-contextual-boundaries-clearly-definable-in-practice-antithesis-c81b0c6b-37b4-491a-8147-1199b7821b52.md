## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a journalist asserts knowing a particular event happened based on sources, but the context changes from informal reporting to a court case where higher evidence is needed. The clarity of boundaries between contexts is ambiguous.**, **It is implausible that contextual boundaries needed to set justification standards can be precisely defined in all instances. Practical applications reveal difficulties in clearly delineating contexts, complicating knowledge claims.**
