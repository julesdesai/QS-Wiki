## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is formed based on memory, such as recalling a phone number. Intuitively, one might argue that this requires past justificatory conditions for it to be considered knowledge. If memories require prior justification, they cannot serve as basic beliefs.**, **It is implausible that all memories arise without needing prior evidential support. Accepting them as foundational violates the rule that memory itself relies upon prior justified beliefs, presenting a problem for the claim that knowledge requires basic beliefs.**
