## Content

**There is a case where a belief-forming process is reliable in a specific instance, like a weather forecast from a normally accurate source, but unreliable when generalized across all contexts.**, **Intuitively, we have to say that believing in the process's reliability in all contexts does not translate to having knowledge when it fails outside its originally tested scope.**
