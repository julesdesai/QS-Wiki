## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, Jamie, forms a belief based on a horoscope prediction, which turns out to be true purely by accident. Intuitively, we either have to say that Jamie knows the proposition predicted by the horoscope or that Jamie does not know it. If we say Jamie knows it, then this implies that unreliable processes can lead to knowledge, which seems incorrect. If we say Jamie does not know it, then justified belief formed reliably seems crucial to avoid luck and ensure knowledge.**
