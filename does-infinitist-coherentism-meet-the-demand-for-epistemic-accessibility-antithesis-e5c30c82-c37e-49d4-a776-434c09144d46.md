## Content

**There is a principle that knowledge must be accessible to the knowing subject, allowing them to sufficiently understand or articulate their justificatory basis.**, **An infinite chain of justification might be too complex or opaque for subjects to access entirely.**, **If justificatory bases are not fully accessible, this threatens the transparency requisite for genuine knowledge possession.**
