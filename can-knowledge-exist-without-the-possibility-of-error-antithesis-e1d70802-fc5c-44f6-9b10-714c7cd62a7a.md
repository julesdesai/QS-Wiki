## Content

**Consider a person who forms a true belief based on infallible but unreflective intuition, such as a spontaneous feeling about something being true. Intuitively, this person seems to lack knowledge because there is no understanding or reasoning involved.**, **There is a plausible principle that states for knowledge, some understanding or reasoning must support the belief. Without it, the belief, even if true and safe, is not knowledge.**
