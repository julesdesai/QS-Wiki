## Content

**Consider a case in which a person forms a justified true belief that also has practical consequences, but this belief is formed through luck rather than knowledge. Intuitively, this situation does not constitute true knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot solely depend on true belief and practical consequences, as Gettier-style examples show gaps in these criteria.**
