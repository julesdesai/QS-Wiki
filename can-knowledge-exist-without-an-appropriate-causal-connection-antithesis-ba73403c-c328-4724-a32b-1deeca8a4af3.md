## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that there will be an earthquake tomorrow because their astrologer predicted it, and an earthquake indeed occurs. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know that the earthquake will happen, despite their belief being true and the event occurring.**, **It is implausible that merely having a true belief about an event with a subsequent causal connection ensures genuine knowledge.**
