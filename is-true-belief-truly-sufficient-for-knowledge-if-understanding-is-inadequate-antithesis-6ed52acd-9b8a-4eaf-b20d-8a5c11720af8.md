## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based entirely on a reliable process but lacks any understanding of why the process is reliable. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge in this scenario.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the understanding of not only the proposition but also the underlying reasons for the reliability of the belief. This principle together with the absence of understanding in the scenario suggests that true belief alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
