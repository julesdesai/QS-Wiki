## Content

**Consider a case where someone happens to make a true belief through unreliable sources, but in all nearby worlds, the belief would still be true despite unreliable processes. Intuitively, we would judge that cases where beliefs are true by fluke do not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that epistemic luck undermines knowledge, which implies that safety cannot fully exclude luck.**
