**Imagine a person, Sarah, who sees a broken clock that coincidentally shows the correct time. She forms a true belief about the time based on the clock. Intuitively, Sarah doesn't truly know the time, even though her belief is true and justified.**, **Misleading evidence, even if it leads to a correct conclusion, can prevent a belief from being true knowledge.**
