**In some contexts, social norms or expectations may set different standards for knowledge than the contextual standards suggested by contextualism.**, **For example, a community might expect high evidence for claims to count as knowledge, even when the context provides a lower standard.**, **This mismatch can lead to confusion or disagreement about whether someone genuinely possesses knowledge.**
