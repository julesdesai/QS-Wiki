**Node ID:** f8191958-eebd-4186-910e-798dce26fd18
**Depth:** 4
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Knowledge with a No-Defeaters Clause](knowledge-with-a-no-defeaters-clause-synthesis-0701b395-900b-40e2-bb7e-a5beb8a1677b.md)

## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person believes a historical fact because multiple independent books agree on it. Intuitively, we might be inclined to think this supports knowledge.**, **Suppose it later comes to light that each book copied the error from a common but flawed source, functioning as a defeater. Intuitively, we would judge that the person did not know the historical fact due to the underlying error, even if there is apparent agreement.**, **The no-defeaters clause cannot account for agreement masking shared errors, suggesting that the concept of defeaters needs more sophistication to match intuitive judgments about knowledge.**
