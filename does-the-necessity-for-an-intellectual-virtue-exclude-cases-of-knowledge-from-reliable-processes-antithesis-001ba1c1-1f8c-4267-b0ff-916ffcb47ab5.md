## Content

**Suppose a scientist routinely uses a reliable thermometer to measure temperature, forming true beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that the scientist knows the temperature through this reliable process rather than through an intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible that knowledge arises only from intellectual virtues, as reliable belief-forming processes can also result in knowledge without necessarily being intellectual virtues.**
