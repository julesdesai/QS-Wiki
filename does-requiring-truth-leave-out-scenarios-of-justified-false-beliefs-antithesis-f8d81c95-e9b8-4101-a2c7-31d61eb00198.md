## Content

**Imagine a detective who, through careful investigation, concludes something false due to misleading, yet compelling evidence. Intuitively, we might want to say the detective knows, even if what they believe is false, due to their justified reasoning process.**, **There is a plausible principle that emphasizes epistemic justification as significant for knowledge. This principle entails that a justified false belief highlights a limitation in views strictly requiring truth for knowledge.**
