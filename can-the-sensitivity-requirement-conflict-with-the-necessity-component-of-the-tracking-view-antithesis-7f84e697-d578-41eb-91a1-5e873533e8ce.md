## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if one knows a proposition, then one would not believe it if it were false. This principle suggests that belief sensitivity to the truth is necessary for knowledge.**, **A case in which a person believes a proposition regardless of whether it is false challenges the necessity condition that requires belief tracking the truth across similar situations. Intuitively, this suggests a problem with considering tracking sufficient for knowledge.**
