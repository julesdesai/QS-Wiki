**Consider Sarah, who has an innate ability to make true predictions about future events without empirical evidence.**, **Her belief "Tomorrow it will rain" is true and formed through this reliable clairvoyant process.**, **Intuitively, we often judge Sarah does not have knowledge due to her lack of understanding or justification of the source, questioning the sufficiency of reliability alone.**
