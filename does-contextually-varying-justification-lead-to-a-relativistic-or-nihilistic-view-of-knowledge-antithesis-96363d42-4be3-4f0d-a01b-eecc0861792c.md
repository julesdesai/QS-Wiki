## Content

**It is implausible that knowledge depends entirely on fluctuating contextual factors, as this would mean the same claim could be both known and not known simultaneously under different contexts.**, **Suppose we have a case where a belief is judged justified in one context and unjustified in another, despite the absence of new evidence. Intuitively, accepting such variability could lead to a relativistic or nihilistic stance on knowledge, where knowledge loses its objective grounding.**
