## Content

**Suppose a case where a person has evidence leading them to believe a proposition, but due to a peculiar set of circumstances, their belief is only true by coincidence. For instance, seeing a stopped clock showing the correct time just as they glance at it. Intuitively, this belief seems justified but does not constitute knowledge.**, **The causal theory asserts that the truth of the belief and the belief itself must be causally connected in an appropriate way. In Gettier cases, the causal chain might exist but is compromised by irrelevant coincidences, leading to true belief without knowledge.**, **If true belief is possible through inappropriate or coincidental causal pathways, it challenges the sufficiency of the causal theory's conditions for knowledge.**
