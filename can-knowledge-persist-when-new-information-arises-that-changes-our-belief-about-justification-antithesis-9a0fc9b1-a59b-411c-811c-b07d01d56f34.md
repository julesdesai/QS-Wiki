**Imagine a scientist justifies that a certain chemical reaction will occur based on established theories and past data.**, **After an experiment, new data emerges that challenges the validity of the initial theories used for justification.**, **Intuitively, one might feel that the scientist did not have knowledge if the justification was undermined by future findings, suggesting knowledge cannot be merely about current justification.**
