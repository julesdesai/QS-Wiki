## Content

**Consider a scenario of tacit knowledge, where an artisan accurately makes a product through ingrained skills without explicitly contemplating the underlying rules or principles. Intuitively, it appears the artisan knows what they are doing even if they do not explicitly hold a belief about it.**, **The claim that tacit knowledge exists challenges the necessity of forming explicit beliefs for knowledge, suggesting knowledge can be present in other forms of understanding not captured by belief.**
