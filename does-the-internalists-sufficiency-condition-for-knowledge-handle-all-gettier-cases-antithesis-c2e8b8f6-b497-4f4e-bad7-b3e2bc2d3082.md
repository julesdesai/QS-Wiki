## Content

**A classic Gettier case involves a person forming a true belief under false premises, where the justification is consciously accessible. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows, despite meeting conditions of belief, truth, and accessible justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that meeting internalist conditions does not suffice for knowledge in all cases, as illustrated by Gettier cases.**, **It is implausible that internalism's conditions are sufficient for knowledge, since they fail to address situations where truth and justification align with an unfounded belief.**
