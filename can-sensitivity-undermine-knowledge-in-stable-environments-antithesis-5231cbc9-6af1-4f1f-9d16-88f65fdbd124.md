## Content

**In stable environments, beliefs are reliably held true; the sensitivity condition might deny knowledge as the belief would remain unchanged even with falsehood injected, conflicting with the notion of stability providing knowledge.**, **A person might rely on well-established scientific theories and hold them true consistently, yet under the sensitivity condition, their knowledge claim could be rejected in hypothetical scenarios where these beliefs are false.**
