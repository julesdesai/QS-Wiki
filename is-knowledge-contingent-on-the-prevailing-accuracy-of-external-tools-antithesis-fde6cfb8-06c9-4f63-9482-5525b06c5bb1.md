## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person relies on a reliable cognitive process that includes the use of external tools, such as technology, which are subject to malfunctions. Intuitively, we either have to say that knowledge cannot depend on such tools or accept that tool reliability contributes to cognitive reliability. If knowledge depends on tools, it questions individual cognitive process reliability.**
