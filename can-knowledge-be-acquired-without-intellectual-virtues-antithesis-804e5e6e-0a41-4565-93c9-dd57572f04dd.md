## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a true belief because they were lucky in guessing a proposition rather than exercising intellectual virtues. In such a case, intuitively, we might still judge that the person does not genuinely know the proposition.**, **The reliance on luck undercuts the sufficiency of the belief being acquired through intellectual virtues, as luck may play a role independent of virtues.**
