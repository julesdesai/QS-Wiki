## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a true belief that coheres with their other beliefs that successfully guide action, but they have no access to the reason why the belief is true. Intuitively, this could lead us to judge that the person does not know the proposition, despite the coherence and practical success of the belief.**, **Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition, it is true, and coheres with other practical beliefs, but the belief was formed randomly. Intuitively, we would judge that this does not constitute knowledge due to the lack of a justified connection.**
