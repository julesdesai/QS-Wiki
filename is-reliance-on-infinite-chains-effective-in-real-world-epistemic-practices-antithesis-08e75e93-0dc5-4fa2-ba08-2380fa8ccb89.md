## Content

**Consider real-world epistemic practices that involve finite, pragmatic assessments. Intuitively, these cannot be reconciled with infinite justification chains.**, **Suppose a personâ€™s justification is an infinite chain; real-world practices prioritize finite, actionable reasoning, making such a chain impractical.**, **It seems implausible that everyday epistemic practices, involving decision-making and finite evidential standards, could coexist with infinite justification principles.**
