## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires some understanding of why a belief is true. This principle suggests that external justification alone may not suffice.**, **Suppose we have a case in which someone believes a true proposition based on external justification, but they have no awareness of the reasons for their belief. Intuitively, we would not say they have knowledge.**
