## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief due to a lucky coincidence, as in classic Gettier cases.**, **Although all conditions for knowledge appear satisfied, intuitively we would not say the person knows because the truth of the belief is due to luck rather than a stable connection through external factors.**, **Such Gettier-style cases suggest that the proposed criteria for knowledge may not be sufficient because they do not account for the role of epistemic luck.**
