## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person comes to believe a true proposition because their environment is manipulated by an external agent to ensure they form this belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, as their belief's truth is not due to their intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that external manipulations undermining the autonomy of belief formation negate any intellectual virtue claims, even if the belief is true and believed.**
