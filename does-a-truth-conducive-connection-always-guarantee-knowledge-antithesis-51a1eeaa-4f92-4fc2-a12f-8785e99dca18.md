## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a true proposition because they formed the belief based on a faulty or superstitious method that accidentally aligns with the truth. Intuitively, we might be reluctant to claim this person knows the proposition.**, **It is plausible to assert that the reliability of the belief-forming process is critical for knowledge. This assertion, together with the possibility of knowledge claims based solely on accidental truths, presents a challenge to the necessity and sufficiency of a truth-conducive connection.**
