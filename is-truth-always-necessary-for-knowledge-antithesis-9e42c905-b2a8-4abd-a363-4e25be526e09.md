**Consider a scenario in which a person believes they know a historical fact that was widely considered true but was later proven false. Intuitively, during the time the fact was considered true, we might still say the person knew it.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can depend on the best available evidence, even if it turns out to be false.
