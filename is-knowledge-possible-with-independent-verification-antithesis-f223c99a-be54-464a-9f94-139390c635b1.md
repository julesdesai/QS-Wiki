## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a particular stock will rise due to a tip from an unknown source, and the stock indeed rises because of a company's executive decision. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of stock performance despite causal alignment.**, **It is implausible that independent and unrelated verification via different sources without understanding the causation is sufficient for knowledge.**
