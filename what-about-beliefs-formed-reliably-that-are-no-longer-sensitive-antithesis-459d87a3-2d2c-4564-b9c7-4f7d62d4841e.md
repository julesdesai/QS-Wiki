## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a security guard sees a clear image of a thief on surveillance footage and comes to believe the thief's identity, but later bases belief purely on a vague memory.**, **Even if the footage had been tampered with, the guard might still maintain belief due to memory, not knowing it misleads.**, **Intuitively, the security guard still knows who the thief is due to initial reliable evidence, even though current belief is not sensitive in the required way.**
