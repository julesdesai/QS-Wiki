# Could logical fallacies that lead to a true conclusion negate knowledge?

**Node Type:** antithesis

## Content

**Consider a mathematician who uses incorrect premises in a flawed set of calculations but arrives at a correct conclusion. The conclusion is true, justified by calculations, and not based on false lemmas. Intuitively, we would judge that the reliance on logical fallacies precludes genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must not stem from faulty reasoning processes. Logical errors in reasoning challenge the status of resulting conclusions as knowledge.**
