## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two basic beliefs that a person holds are contradictory but individually seem self-evident to different domains of knowledge. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that not both can be true.**, **There is a plausible principle that individual self-evident beliefs may conflict, thus undermining the coherence of a person's justification for their knowledge.**
