## Content

**Consider a process that is reliable under normal conditions, like a compass for navigation.**, **In a scenario near a magnetic anomaly, the compass gives incorrect directions.**, **Although the belief about direction is formed by a reliable process, it is not true in this situation.**, **Reliably produced beliefs can still be false, hence not sufficient for knowledge.**
