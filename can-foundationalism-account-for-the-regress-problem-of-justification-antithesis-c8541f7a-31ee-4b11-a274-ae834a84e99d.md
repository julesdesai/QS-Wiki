## Content

**There is a plausible principle that every belief requires a justification. This principle together with the idea that basic beliefs do not require further justification leads to the question of what stops the regress of justification.**, **Consider a scenario where a basic belief is assumed to not need further justification. Intuitively, this absence of further justification seems arbitrary, posing a challenge to foundationalism.**
