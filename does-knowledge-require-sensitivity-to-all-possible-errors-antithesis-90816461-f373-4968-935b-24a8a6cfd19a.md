## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires sensitivity to all possible errors. This principle together with the possibility of unnoticed flaws in reasoning or evidence entails that sensitivity is not always possible.**, **Suppose a person believes a proposition based on strong but misleading evidence. Intuitively, they would not know the proposition if the evidence is revealed to be false, but they may still believe it in the face of counterevidence.**, **Knowledge cannot rely solely on current belief and truth conditions because it must also account for potential errors that might not be detected through normal belief revision.**
