## Content

**Consider a person who guesses an answer correctly due to a gut feeling that frequently works for them in the past and thus believes their answer by reliable instantiation. Intuitively, we would judge that the correct guess, despite its truth and reliable outcome, does not constitute knowledge in the absence of discernible justification.**, **The improbability of distinguishing between genuine knowledge and lucky guesswork undercuts the sufficiency of reliable processes alone in the absence of clear justification.**
