## Content

**Consider a scenario where the context of evaluation significantly shifts what is considered a "nearby possible world." In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that contextual factors affect whether one has knowledge, suggesting variability in what counts as a nearby world reduces the theory's reliability.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should not vary with minor contextual changes; however, the reliance on nearby possible worlds introduces such variability.**
