## Content

**Consider a scenario where a doctor's diagnosis is based on intuition fueled by years of experience rather than explicit virtuous reasoning. Intuitively, we might grant this as a form of knowledge despite departing from traditional virtue epistemology pathways.**
**A case where intuitive insights, not directly traceable to intellectual virtues, consistently inform beliefs questions the sufficiency of intellectual virtue as the sole path to knowledge.**
**It is plausible that complex realms where intuitive and pragmatic approaches yield knowledge show that relying solely on explicit intellectual virtue is overly restrictive.**
