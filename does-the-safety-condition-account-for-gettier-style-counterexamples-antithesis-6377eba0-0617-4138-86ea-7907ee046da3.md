## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief based on justified reasoning, but unknown to them, the justification involves a false premise, similar to classic Gettier cases.**, **The belief could not easily have been false since the reasoning process is generally reliable.**, **Intuitively, such a case is not considered knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of the safety condition.**
