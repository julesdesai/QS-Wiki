## Content

**It is implausible that people can communicate effectively about knowledge claims if contextual standards are not shared or understood across different contexts.**, **Suppose two individuals from disparate contexts with different standards for justification discuss a knowledge claim. The first person says they know the claim based on their context, while the other finds the justification insufficient. Intuitively, such communication leads to confusion or misinterpretation of the claim.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge communication should be clear enough to transcend contextual differences, ensuring mutual understanding.**
