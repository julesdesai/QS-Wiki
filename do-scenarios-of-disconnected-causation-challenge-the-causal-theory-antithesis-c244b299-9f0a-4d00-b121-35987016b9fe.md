## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist discovers a truth, such as the existence of a rare element, purely through theoretical deduction with no empirical basis initially supporting it. Intuitively, we might judge that the scientist knows the truth, even though there is an absence of direct causal interaction with the element itself.**, **The causal theory suggests that knowledge requires a causal connection between truth and belief. However, in cases of theoretical deduction or mathematical truths, the causal interaction may be indirect or non-existent, challenging the necessity of such connections.**, **If certain truths, especially those in mathematics or theoretical science, do not per se require a direct causal connection to be known, this poses a challenge to the causal theory as currently formulated.**
