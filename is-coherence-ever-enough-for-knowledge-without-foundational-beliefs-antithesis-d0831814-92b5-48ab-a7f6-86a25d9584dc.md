## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person's belief system is completely coherent, but no beliefs are based on foundational justifications. Intuitively, we would judge that the person possesses knowledge, which challenges the necessity of foundational beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence among beliefs can provide justification for those beliefs. This implies that foundational beliefs are not always necessary for knowledge.**
