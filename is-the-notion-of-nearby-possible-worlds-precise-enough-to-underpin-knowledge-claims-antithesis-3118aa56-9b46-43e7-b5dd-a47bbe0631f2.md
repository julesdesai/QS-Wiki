## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual forms a belief based on reliable testimonial evidence, and it is coincidentally true. A shift in the reliability of the testimonial evidence in nearby possible worlds is ambiguous and underdetermined. The lack of clarity challenges the sufficiency of the connection between truth and belief across possible worlds.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true.**
