## Content

**There is a plausible principle that specifies that knowledge requires identifying which specific level of generality a belief-forming process should be evaluated at.**, **This principle together with the variety of possible descriptions for any process (e.g., “Seeing the dog” vs. “Seeing at dusk”) entails a difficulty in applying a consistent standard of reliability.**
