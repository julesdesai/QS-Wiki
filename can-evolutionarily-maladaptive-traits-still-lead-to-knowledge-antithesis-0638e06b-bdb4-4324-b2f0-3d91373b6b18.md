## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a cognitive trait evolves by chance, which instead of being beneficial, inadvertently enhances individual truth-finding in a specific domain such as mathematical reasoning. In such a scenario, this trait seems to provide genuine knowledge despite its lack of adaptive purpose.**, **The availability of reliable cognitive outputs that are non-adaptive challenges the demand that proper functioning aligns with an organismâ€™s beneficial design plan for knowledge.**
