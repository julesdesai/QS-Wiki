## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person glances at a malfunctioning clock showing the correct time by accident.**, **Even though the sensitivity condition might be satisfied if the clock consistently shows the wrong time when false, the knowledge claim seems reliant on accidental truth.**, **Coincidental truth satisfying the sensitivity condition but undermining reliability questions its sufficiency for knowledge.**
