## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person deduces a true proposition from a false premise, but there is an indirect causal connection through some correct principle. Intuitively, we would judge that this belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **Causal chains can be indirect and complicated, leading to cases where a causal connection exists, but does not provide knowledge.**
