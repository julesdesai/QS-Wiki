## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person's belief is true and tracks the truth across possible worlds. However, the true belief arises due to deceptive or misleading evidence, similar to Gettier-style cases. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge due to the unjustified circumstances of the belief's formation.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not only be about truth-tracking but also about originating from justification devoid of deceit or luck.**
