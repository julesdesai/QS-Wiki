## Content

**Consider a scenario where two people have different sets of core beliefs that are internally coherent but contradictory to each other. Intuitively, we would judge that not both can possess knowledge, as knowledge requires truth.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should be clearly distinguishable between competing coherent systems.**
