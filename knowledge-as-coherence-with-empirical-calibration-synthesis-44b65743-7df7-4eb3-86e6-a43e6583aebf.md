**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is grounded in basic beliefs that are intrinsically justified**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs grounded in basic beliefs**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the coherent belief system is calibrated against empirical data**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, the belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs grounded in intrinsically justified basic beliefs, and the coherent belief system is calibrated against empirical data**
