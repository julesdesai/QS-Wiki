## Content

**Consider a scenario where intuition and deductive reasoning both lead to true beliefs. Intuition in some contexts is less reliable than deductive reasoning. Intuitively, we would think that knowledge requires more than just any form of reliability, differentiating between types of cognitive processes.**, **It is implausible that the concept of reliability in epistemology treats all cognitive processes as equally valid, as it fails to account for varying degrees of reliability across different cognitive methods.**
