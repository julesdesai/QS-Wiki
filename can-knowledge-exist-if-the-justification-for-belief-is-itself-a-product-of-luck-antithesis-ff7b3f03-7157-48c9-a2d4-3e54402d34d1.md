## Content

**A person forms a belief about a proposition based on the testimony of a reliable friend who unknowingly only got their information from an unreliable source yet by chance gives accurate information.**, **The person's belief is true, they have justification from their friend's testimony, and it appears to be free from epistemic luck.**, **It is plausible to claim that the justification itself is a product of luck, leading to the question of whether this affects the status of the belief as knowledge.**
