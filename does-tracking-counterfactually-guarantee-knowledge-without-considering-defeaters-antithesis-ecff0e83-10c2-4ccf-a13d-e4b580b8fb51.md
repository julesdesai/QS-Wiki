## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person reads a reliable thermometer and believes it is 72 degrees. If the thermometer were malfunctioning but still displaying 72 degrees, they would still believe it is 72 degrees. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires being sensitive to the presence of defeaters. Since the person does not track such defeaters, they do not have knowledge.**
