## Content

**Consider a scenario where, due to sheer coincidence, a person trusts a normally unreliable source, believes a true proposition, and all these conditions are met coincidentally. Intuitively, we would judge that the individual does not know the proposition because the alignment was accidental.**, **It is implausible that accidental coincidental alignment of conditions could fulfill the requirements for genuine knowledge.**
