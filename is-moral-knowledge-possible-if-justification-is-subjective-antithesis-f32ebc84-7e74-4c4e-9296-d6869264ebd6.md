## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a moral proposition based on subjective justification, like personal intuition. Intuitively, we either have to say that this person knows the proposition, which makes knowledge potentially unstable, or they do not know, which questions the sufficiency of justification and truth for moral knowledge.**
