## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief using a reliable cognitive process that is subject to contextual factors. Intuitively, we may judge that the belief is knowledge in one context but not in another.**, **The context-dependence of reliable processes suggests that knowledge itself may be contextual, challenging the sufficiency of reliabilism as an all-encompassing definition.**
