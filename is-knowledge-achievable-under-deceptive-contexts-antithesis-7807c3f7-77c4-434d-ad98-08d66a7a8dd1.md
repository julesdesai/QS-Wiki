## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a magicianâ€™s audience is led to believe through illusion that an object is levitating, a belief justified by sensory experience within the context of a show. If the object only seems to levitate, intuitively, it appears they do not truly know the object levitates despite contextual justification suggesting otherwise.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be attained in contexts designed to deceive, as genuine knowledge requires justification not compromised by manipulated perceptions, underscoring a contextual limitation.**
