**There is a plausible principle that justification should not vary based on a personâ€™s subjective concerns in theoretical factual matters, only in pragmatic contexts.**, **Consider a person with a different set of practical concerns believing the same theoretical proposition differently.**, **Intuitively, we might find it inconsistent for justification of factual knowledge to vary with practical stakes when facts should remain constant across subjects.**
