## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a belief is formed independently of the causal chain that would normally establish it, as when a person holds a longstanding belief that is later verified by new evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that pre-existing belief complicates the causal narrative necessary for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge acquisition depends on beliefs aligning with the causal process that confers justification. This principle suggests that independent prior beliefs may disrupt the causal connections posited as necessary for knowledge.**
