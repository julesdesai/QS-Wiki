## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a belief that is true purely by chance, such as guessing the outcome of a coin flip. The belief is true but arises randomly.**, **A plausible principle in epistemology suggests that simply having a belief that turns out true by chance doesn't constitute knowledge.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person doesn't actually have knowledge, even though their belief is true.**
