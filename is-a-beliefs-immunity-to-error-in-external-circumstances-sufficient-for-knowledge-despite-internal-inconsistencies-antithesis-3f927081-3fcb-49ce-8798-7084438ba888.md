## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a true belief that is immune to error only because of external circumstances, while internally their understanding or evidence contradicts the belief. Intuitively, we would judge that this disparity between external and internal states means the person does not possess knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that internal consistency and coherence are necessary for knowledge, indicating that external safety alone does not suffice.**
