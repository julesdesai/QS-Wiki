## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person gains a true belief from a source known to be generally reliable, but the person does not have evidence about this specific proposition's truth. Intuitively, we either have to say that testimony-based knowledge does not require evidence or that not all true beliefs from reliable testimony count as knowledge.**
