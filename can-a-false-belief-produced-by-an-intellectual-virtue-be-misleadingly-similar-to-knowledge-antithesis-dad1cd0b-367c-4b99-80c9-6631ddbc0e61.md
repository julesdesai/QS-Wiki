## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses an intellectual virtue to form a belief that closely resembles many true beliefs, yet it is false due to rare misleading circumstances. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge even though their process is generally virtuous.**, **There is a plausible principle that states knowledge must not only be true and virtuous but also immune to misleading similarities with error. This principle together with the scenario entails a need for further conditions beyond intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
