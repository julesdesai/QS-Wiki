## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person sees a barn and believes it to be real, surrounded by numerous fake barns, where the belief tracks truth in this instance. Intuitively, this does not seem to count as knowledge due to environmental deception.**, **The prevalence of indistinguishable fake barns introduces environmental factors that, despite successful tracking, undermine knowledge due to deceptive surroundings.**
