## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on intuition rather than reasoning. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, even though the belief is true and possibly linked to some virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a reliable process. Relying on an unreliable intellectual virtue does not entail that a person knows something, even if the belief happens to be true.**
