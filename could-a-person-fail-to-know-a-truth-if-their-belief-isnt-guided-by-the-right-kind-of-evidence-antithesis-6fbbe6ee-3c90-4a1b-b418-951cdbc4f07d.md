## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone believes a true proposition based solely on reading it in an unreliable tabloid. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition, because their true belief is not based on reliable evidence, even though it might not easily have been false.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires beliefs to be based on appropriate evidence, meaning that true belief alone, irrespective of its resistance to falsity, does not suffice for knowledge if the evidence is inadequate.**
