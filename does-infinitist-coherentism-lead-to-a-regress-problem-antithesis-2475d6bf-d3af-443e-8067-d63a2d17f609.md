## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be justified, each link in its chain of justification must itself be justified. This principle together with the requirement for an infinite chain leads to an infinite regress of justificatory demands.**, **If every justifying belief requires further justification, then initiating an infinite chain without a foundational belief becomes a logical impossibility.**, **Infinitist coherentism might, therefore, lead to a vicious regress, where justification is endlessly deferred, posing a threat to the possibility of knowledge.**
