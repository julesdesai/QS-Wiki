## Content

**Suppose a person holds beliefs about moral truths that are deeply intuitive or emotional rather than based on probabilistic reasoning. Intuitively, these moral beliefs can still amount to knowledge.**, **It is implausible to require moral knowledge to always align with probabilistic reasoning, as moral beliefs often derive from normative, rather than empirical, considerations.**
