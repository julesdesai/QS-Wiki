## Content

**Consider a case in which a scientist predicts, using current data and reliable models, that a comet will collide with Earth in a year. Six months later, gravitational perturbations adjust the comet's trajectory, averting impact. The pre-alteration belief, though grounded in reliable prediction, seems not to be knowledge post-outcome, intuitively, because the fact it propositions changed.**
