## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a reliable cognitive process consistently produces true beliefs but is momentarily influenced in producing a false belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the false belief can be mistaken for knowledge due to past reliability.**, **A case exists where a usually reliable process gives a false result, which we might mistakenly consider as knowledge due to its usual reliability.**
