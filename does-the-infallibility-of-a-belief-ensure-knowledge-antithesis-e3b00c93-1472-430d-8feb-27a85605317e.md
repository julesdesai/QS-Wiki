## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a complex mathematical proposition due to a conjecture and luck, rather than any reasoned proof, and the proposition turns out to be true. Although not inferred from any falsehood, intuitively, we would doubt that the belief is knowledge.**, **It is implausible that merely having a true belief, without adequately understanding or just analyzing why it is true, constitutes knowledge.**
