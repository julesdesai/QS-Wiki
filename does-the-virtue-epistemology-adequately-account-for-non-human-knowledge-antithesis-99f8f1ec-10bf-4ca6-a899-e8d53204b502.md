**Consider a well-trained dog reliably signaling the presence of a specific person due to conditioning and perceptual acuity. Intuitively, the dog's behavior reflects ‘knowledge’ but not intellectual virtue.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should encompass entities capable of belief and truth discrimination, challenging the sufficiency of virtue epistemology focused on intellectual agents alone.**
