## Content

**Consider a scenario where the dominant social group within a society holds a belief that excludes the minority's perspective. In this scenario, the socially validated system may not account for the minority's knowledge claims, leading to a false consensus that ignores valid propositions known by marginalized individuals.**, **A system can be socially validated within a particular cultural or social group, thereby excluding other valid belief systems that hold different truths. This suggests that social validation does not necessarily entail inclusivity of all true knowledge.**
