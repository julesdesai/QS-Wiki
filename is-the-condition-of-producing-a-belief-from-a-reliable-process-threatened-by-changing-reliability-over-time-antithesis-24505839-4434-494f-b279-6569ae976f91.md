## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief-forming process is reliable at one time but becomes unreliable due to technological, environmental, or societal changes. Intuitively, beliefs formed after the change are not based on knowledge.**, **A process that becomes unreliable over time raises questions about the sufficiency of reliability as a criterion for knowledge.**
