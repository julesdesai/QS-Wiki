## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a universally acknowledged scientific fact is known in some contexts but not in others, based on differing justification standards. Intuitively, scientific knowledge should be universally applicable and not subject to contextual differences.**, **It is implausible that scientific truths, which have consistent empirical support, should depend on variable contextual justifications to be considered knowledge, as this goes against the universal nature of scientific facts.**
