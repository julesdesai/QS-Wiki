## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief by using intellectual virtues in an inappropriate context, such as applying skepticism where it leads to unnecessary doubt. Intuitively, we might judge that the belief, though true, does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that the application of intellectual virtue should be appropriate to the context of inquiry. Misapplication undermines the sufficiency of intellectual virtue alone for accounting for knowledge.**, **If a true belief can arise from the inappropriate use of intellectual virtue but lacks contextual aptness, intellectual virtue alone may be insufficient for defining knowledge.**
