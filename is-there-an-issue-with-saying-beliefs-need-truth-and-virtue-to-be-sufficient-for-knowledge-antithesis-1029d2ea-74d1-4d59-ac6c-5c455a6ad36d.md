## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through intellectual virtue and the proposition is true, but the justification for the belief is weak or unrelated, leading to accidental truth. Intuitively, such a case may not seem to be one of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that strong justifications linking belief and truth are necessary for knowledge beyond mere true belief formed through intellectual virtue. This questions whether the sufficiency clause here adequately captures the essence of knowledge.**
