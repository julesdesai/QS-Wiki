**Consider a scientist using Method A, a reliable process, to conclude about a phenomenon, while equally valid Method B suggests a contrary conclusion.**, **Both methods are independently reliable, and belief formed via each is assumed true under certain conditions.**, **Intuitively, the conflicting results from equally reliable processes cast doubt on which conclusion should constitute knowledge.**
