## Content

**Imagine a scenario where changing social norms alter what counts as justification for a belief, thus affecting whether a proposition is considered knowledge. Intuitively, such a fluctuation could prevent knowledge from being reliably stable over time.**, **The dependency of knowledge on mutable contextual justifications raises concerns about its stability and threatens the reliability of knowledge claims.**
