## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person holds a belief that aligns with their foundational beliefs, yet this belief is entirely disconnected from observable evidence, remaining true by mere accident. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not possess knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence alone cannot substitute for the direct correspondence with reality necessary for knowledge.**
