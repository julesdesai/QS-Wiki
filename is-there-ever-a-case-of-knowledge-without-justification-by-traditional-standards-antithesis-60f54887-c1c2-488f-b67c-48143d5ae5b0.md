## Content

**Suppose a person randomly guesses an answer on a multiple-choice quiz and gets it right. Intuitively, most would say this guess does not constitute knowledge despite the belief being true.**, **This scenario suggests that justification is necessary for knowledge even when belief and truth coincide.**, **There are cases where intuitive knowledge does not rely on strong justification but rather reliable methods or sources unknown to the believer.**
