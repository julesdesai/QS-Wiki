## Content

**There is a plausible principle, known as the closure principle, which states that if someone knows a proposition and that this proposition entails another, then they should know the entailed proposition as well. This principle together with varying contextual standards for knowledge might allow for instances where someone knows a proposition but not the entailments, conflicting with the closure principle.**, **If the standards change significantly from one context to another, maintaining closure becomes practically implausible.**
