## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person arrives at a true belief through reckless conjecture, which is generally considered an intellectual vice. Intuitively, it seems surprising to exclude this belief from being called knowledge if it is true and justified.**, **Suppose an individual arrives at a true and justified belief by stubbornly refusing to change their mind due to excessive dogmatism. It is counterintuitive to suggest that their belief cannot be knowledge because it arose from a vice.**
