## Content

**Suppose an individual learns a fact through a scientifically established method but this method fails in some nearby possible worlds while still maintaining true belief. Intuitively, we might say the individual's belief constitutes knowledge even though it fails safety constraints.**, **It is implausible that safety would entirely substitute epistemic justification as it overlooks the depth of validation that justification adds.**
