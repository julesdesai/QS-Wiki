## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a group unanimously agrees that a certain incorrect interpretation of historical events is true. In such a scenario, the belief is part of a socially validated system, yet intuitively, this system's acceptance does not make the belief true.**, **A belief can be part of a socially validated system without increasing its reliability in tracking truth. This means that even if a socially validated belief system endorses a proposition, it may not truly be knowledge if the system itself is not aligned with reality.**
