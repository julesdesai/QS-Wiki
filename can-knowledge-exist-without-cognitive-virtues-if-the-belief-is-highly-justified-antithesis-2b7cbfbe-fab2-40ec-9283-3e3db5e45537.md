## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief based on overwhelming evidence but not as a result of any particular cognitive virtues. Intuitively, it seems that the person has knowledge in this case.**, **There is a plausible principle that overwhelming evidence can suffice for knowledge independently of cognitive virtues. This principle together with the quality of the evidence entails that the belief constitutes knowledge.**
