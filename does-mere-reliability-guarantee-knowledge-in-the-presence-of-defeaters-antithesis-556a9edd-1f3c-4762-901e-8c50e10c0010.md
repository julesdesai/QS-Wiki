## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person is given a piece of evidence that, if known, would prevent them from forming a belief, such as a reliable friend telling them that the hologram is deceptive. Intuitively, even if the belief is true and formed by a reliable process, we would not consider this knowledge because the defeater undercuts their justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must not only be formed by a reliable process but also be undefeated by counter-evidence, which suggests the necessity of recognizing defeaters.**
