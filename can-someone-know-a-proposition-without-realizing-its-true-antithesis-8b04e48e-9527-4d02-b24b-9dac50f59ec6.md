## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Tom, believes his friend's alibi, which is true, through intellectual virtue, but remains fundamentally unsure of the truth despite this belief. Intuitively, we might say Tom does not know the proposition is true.**
**Suppose we have a case in which a person doubts the truth of their belief, regardless of its virtuous formation and truth value. This doubt challenges the idea that knowledge is present.**
**It is implausible to claim knowledge exists where acknowledgment of truth in one's belief is absent. The lack of confidence undermines knowledge attribution.**
