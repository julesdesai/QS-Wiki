## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on vivid but false memories, making the belief fit coherently within their system of beliefs. Intuitively, in this case, we would judge that the person does not actually know the proposition.**, **A coherent but false belief based on internal consistency in one's beliefs does not provide knowledge.**, **It is implausible that mere coherence with a set of beliefs is sufficient to constitute knowledge.**
