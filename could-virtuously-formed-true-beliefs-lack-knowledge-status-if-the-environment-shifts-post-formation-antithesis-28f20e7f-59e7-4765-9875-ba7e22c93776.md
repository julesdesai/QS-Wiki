## Content

**Consider a case where a person forms a true belief through a reliable process in a conducive environment, but the environment changes after the belief is formed to be non-conducive, introducing doubt. Intuitively, we would judge that the person's belief could cease to be knowledge.**, **It is implausible that environmental conditions at different times after the belief's formation should alter the knowledge status of a belief that was formed reliably.**
