**Consider a case where a person uses a normally reliable cognitive process which, due to unusual circumstances, produces a false belief; the potential for error appears despite the general reliability of the process.**, **Reliability does not guarantee accurate results in every instance and thus, simply relying on reliability might not suffice for knowledge in cases with atypical exceptions.**
