## Content

**Consider a scenario where Dana hears on the radio that an important event will occur. The broadcast is actually mistaken, yet the event coincidentally takes place because of unrelated incidents. Intuitively we determine whether Dana knew the event would occur based on contextual correctness rather than sheer randomness.**, **A plausible principle suggests contextual factors can mediate perceived epistemic luck, where sufficiency for knowledge depends on the context of truth and belief rather than absence of luck alone.**, **Reliance on sufficiency by negating luck without acknowledging contextual nuances signals an inadequacy inherent in the current anti-luck account to inform genuine epistemic claims.**
