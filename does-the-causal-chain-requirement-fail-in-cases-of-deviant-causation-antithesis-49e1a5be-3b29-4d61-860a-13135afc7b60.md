## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition due to a deviant causal chain, like a coincidence or an accidental trigger. In such a scenario, intuitively we might not say the person knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not just any causal connection, but a proper or appropriate causal connection. This principle, when applied to deviant causation scenarios, questions whether mere causation suffices for knowledge.**
