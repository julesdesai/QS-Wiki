## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person sees a tree in the distance and, due to poor eyesight, believes it to be a large rock. Intuitively, we would judge that they have perceptual justification for believing there is an object there, but not that it is a rock.**, **A person may have perceptual justification for their belief about the object's existence, yet lack knowledge about its nature due to faulty perception.**
