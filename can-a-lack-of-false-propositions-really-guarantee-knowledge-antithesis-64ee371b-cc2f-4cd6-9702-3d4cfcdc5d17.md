## Content

**Consider a situation where a person holds a true belief and no false proposition could defeat it, yet the belief is based on unreliable or biased reasoning. Intuitively, the reliability of the reasoning seems to matter for knowing the proposition.**, **If the absence of false propositions is not enough, then defeasibility alone is insufficient for knowledge.**
