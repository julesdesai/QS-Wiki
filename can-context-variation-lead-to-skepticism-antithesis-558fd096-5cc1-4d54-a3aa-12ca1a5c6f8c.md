## Content

**Consider a scenario in which epistemic standards rise drastically, such as in a philosophical debate context. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that if knowing depends on context, most ordinary knowledge claims become false, leading to skepticism.**, **Suppose we accept that standards for knowledge change with context. Intuitively, we would expect that almost all knowledge claims could be challenged under higher scrutiny, threatening whether we ever have true knowledge at all.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should help us navigate the world reliably. If the context sensitivity of knowledge implies that we are constantly at risk of not knowing under higher standards, then this principle is undermined.**
