## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which person Q believes a proposition based on an ostensibly trustworthy testimony. Even though the testimony contains no direct falsehoods, it implies a broader false context unknown to Q. Intuitively, we must either conclude that Q knows the proposition despite missing this false context or does not know it due to this implication. If we say Q knows, it challenges the no falsehood requirement's sufficiency for knowledge. If we say Q does not know, it suggests complications beyond direct evidence and truth.**
