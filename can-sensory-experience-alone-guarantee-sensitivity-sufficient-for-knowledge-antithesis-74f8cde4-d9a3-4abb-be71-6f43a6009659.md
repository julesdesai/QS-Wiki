## Content

**Suppose a person forms beliefs about their environment solely through sensory experience, such as seeing a red apple on a table, but without deeper understanding or reflection. Intuitively, sensory observation alone may not ensure knowledge if the experience is misleading or incomplete.**, **There is a plausible principle that sensitivity requires more than mere sensory data, acknowledging the role of cognitive processing for validating true propositions beyond perceptual immediacy.**, **Relying solely on sensory experience for belief formation challenges the adequacy of the sensitivity condition, because genuine knowledge typically involves synthesis and evaluation beyond raw perception.**
