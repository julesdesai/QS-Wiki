## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes they know they are eating an apple based on contextual cues, but objectively it is a pear. In such a situation, intuitively we might say that taking context into account leads to misidentifying knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be able to account for and identify errors across different contexts; the context-dependence of justification in this case prevents this consistency.**
