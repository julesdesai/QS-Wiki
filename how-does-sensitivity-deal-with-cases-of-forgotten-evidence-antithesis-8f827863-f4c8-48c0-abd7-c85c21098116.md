## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person learned a historical fact with strong evidence but has since forgotten the evidence and believes the fact correctly.**, **Intuitively, the person is considered to know the historical fact despite lacking a current, conscious sensitivity to the possibility of it being false.**, **For sensitivity, if the historical fact were false, the person must not believe it, but in reality, they might still believe the fact due to historical belief despite forgetting the bases for sensitivity.**
