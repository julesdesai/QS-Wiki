## Content

**Consider the principle that knowledge should exclude epistemic luck. This principle together with the claim that a belief being safely true implies knowledge entails that safety precludes epistemic luck.**, **It is implausible that safety by itself can ensure the absence of epistemic luck because a belief might remain safely true in some worlds due to factors like coincidence rather than epistemic robustness.**
