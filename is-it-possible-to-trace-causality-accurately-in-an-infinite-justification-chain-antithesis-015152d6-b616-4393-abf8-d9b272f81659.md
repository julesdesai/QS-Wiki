## Content

**There is a plausible principle that tracing causal pathways accurately requires a finite and manageable network of reasons. This principle together with the requirement for infinite chains suggests that beyond a certain point, accurately verifying these causal links becomes untenable.**, **Consider a scenario where complex scientific theories demand an infinite causal justification chain. Theoretically, if causality is accurately traced back infinitely, this would demand unrealistic precision in documenting the intricate causal history of empirical observations.**
