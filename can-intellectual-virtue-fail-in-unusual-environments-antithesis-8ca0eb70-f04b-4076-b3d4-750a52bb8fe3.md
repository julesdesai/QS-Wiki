## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an intellectual virtue leads to a true belief in a normal setting, but in a chaotic or misleading environment, the same virtue results in falsehood. This inconsistency challenges whether intellectual virtue consistently contributes to knowledge.**
**Consider a scenario where an environment like a hall of mirrors misleads beliefs formed with virtue, even though such beliefs may be true elsewhere. Such scenarios intuitively question the reliability and sufficiency of virtue alone for knowledge.**
**It is plausible that external conditions can interfere with intellectual virtues, suggesting virtue alone may not be sufficient for justifying knowledge across various contexts.**
