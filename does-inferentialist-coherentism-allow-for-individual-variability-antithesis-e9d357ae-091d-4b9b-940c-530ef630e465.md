## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two individuals have thoroughly different sets of coherent beliefs, one leading to true propositions, the other to systematically false propositions. Intuitively, individualized knowledge claims seem problematic in such relativized coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that objective truths should hold universally, beyond individual coherence systems. This undermines the sufficiency of inferentialist coherentism for universal knowledge claims.**
