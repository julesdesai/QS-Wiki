## Content

**Consider a case where person P needs knowledge about a deadline to make a high-stakes decision. Even with true belief and justification, if P faces high practical stakes, intuitively, P may not be considered to know due to increased consequence sensitivity.**, **A plausible principle is that the stakes involved in decision-making impact whether true justified belief amounts to knowledge. This principle challenges the view that knowledge is independent of pragmatic considerations.**
