## Content

**Suppose we have identical belief-forming processes used by two people, but contextually one often results in truth and the other in falsehood. Intuitively, either context should not affect reliability, or reliability must be context-dependent.**, **If we say context does affect reliability, it suggests that external conditions heavily influence what counts as knowledge, challenging simple reliability.**
