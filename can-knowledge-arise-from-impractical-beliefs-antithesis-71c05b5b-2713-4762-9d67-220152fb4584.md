## Content

**Suppose a person, Eli, has a belief that is true but entirely impractical or irrelevant to any decision-making aspect of life. Intuitively, Eli still possesses knowledge of some fact about the world.**, **The necessity for belief to have practical consequences may disregard true beliefs that are useful for theoretical or aesthetic understanding without direct practical impact.**, **Many scientific truths have no immediate practical consequences but are still considered knowledge, suggesting practical consequence is not a universal requirement for knowledge.**
