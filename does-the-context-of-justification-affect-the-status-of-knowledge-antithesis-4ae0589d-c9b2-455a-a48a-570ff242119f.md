## Content

**Consider a situation where different contexts provide different levels of justification for the same belief. Intuitively, knowledge might require a context with stronger justification, suggesting contextual variance affects the sufficiency of justified true belief.**, **There is an intuition that varying contexts alter the adequacy of justification required for knowledge. This challenges the sufficiency of justified true belief with no defeaters for context-independent knowledge.**
