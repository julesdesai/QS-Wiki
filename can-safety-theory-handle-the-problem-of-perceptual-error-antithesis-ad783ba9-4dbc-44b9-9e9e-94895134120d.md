## Content

**Suppose a person perceives a bent stick in the water without realizing refraction, leading them to believe it is bent when it is straight. In nearby possible worlds with this belief, the stick is seen bent falsely. Intuitively, perceptual error challenges the claim to knowledge.**, **Scenarios where lighting or illusions trick perception prompt faulty beliefs, implying in nearby worlds the belief remains false, thereby not constituting knowledge. Intuitive judgments of knowledge become unstable under these conditions.**
