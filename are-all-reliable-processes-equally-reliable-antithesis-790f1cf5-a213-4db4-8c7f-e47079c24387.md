## Content

**There is a plausible principle that some cognitive processes are more reliable than others based on their track records. This principle together with different contexts entails that equal reliability cannot be assumed universally.**, **Suppose we have two processes providing the same true belief but with different degrees of reliability over time. Intuitively, we would weigh their reliability differently.**
