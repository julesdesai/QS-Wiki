## Content

**Consider a situation where a person, Linda, sees what she thinks is a sheep on a hill. In reality, she is looking at a cleverly disguised dog, but coincidentally, there is a real sheep hidden from view. Intuitively, Linda's belief that there is a sheep on the hill, although true and justified, does not constitute knowledge.**, **True beliefs might lack the necessary causal connection to the facts that they describe, which prevents them from being knowledge.**
