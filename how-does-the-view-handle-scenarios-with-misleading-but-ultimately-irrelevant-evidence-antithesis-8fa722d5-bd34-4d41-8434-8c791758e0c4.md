## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a justified true belief externally confirmed but also holds misleading evidence that seems to defeat their belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows or does not know the proposition.**, **If we say the person knows, there is a conflict with the intuition that misleading evidence can undermine knowledge.**, **If we say the person does not know, it implies that external justification is not sufficient, contradicting the view.**
