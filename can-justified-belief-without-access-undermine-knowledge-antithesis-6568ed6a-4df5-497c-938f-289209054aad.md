## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes a proposition and the proposition is true. Intuitively, if the person has no access to the justification for their belief due to lack of understanding or awareness, we would judge that they do not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a person to be at least minimally aware of the justification for their belief.**
