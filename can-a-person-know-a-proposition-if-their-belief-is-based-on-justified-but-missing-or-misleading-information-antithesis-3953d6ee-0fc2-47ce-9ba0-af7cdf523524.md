## Content

**Consider a scenario where a student is studying a subject and receives extensive feedback that is accurate but omits a critical error in their understanding. The student believes the proposition to be true due to this feedback. The belief is justified and the proposition true. Intuitively, we would judge the student does not have knowledge because critical information was missing.**, **There is a plausible principle that if knowledge is based on justified information, all relevant information should be correct and complete. The omission of critical aspects contradicts this principle, suggesting a gap in the conditions for knowledge.**
