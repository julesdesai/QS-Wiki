## Content

**Suppose there is a case in which a person P simply has a gut feeling or intuition that a math problemâ€™s solution is correct and indeed it is correct. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say P knows the solution is correct if P cannot explain why or how they arrived at that intuition.**, **If knowing requires intellectual virtue or competence, the reliance on unarticulated intuition challenges the requirement of explicit cognitive ability typically associated with such virtue or competence.**
