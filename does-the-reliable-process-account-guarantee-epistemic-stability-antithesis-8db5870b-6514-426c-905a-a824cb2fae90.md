## Content

**Imagine a true belief formed through a reliable process which is later contested due to compelling counter-evidence; the belief remains unchanged due to stubbornness, not additional reliable processing. Intuitively, we might deny that this belief remains knowledge under circumstances of epistemic instability.**, **Knowledge should embody a robustness against defeaters, where reliability of belief formation alone does not assure the ongoing epistemic worthiness of holding a belief.**
