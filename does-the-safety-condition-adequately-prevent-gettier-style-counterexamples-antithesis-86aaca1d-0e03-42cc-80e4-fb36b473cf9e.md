## Content

**Consider a classic Gettier case where a person believes the proposition that the person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket. This belief is formed based on misleading evidence but turns out to be true because, coincidentally, another candidate also has ten coins and gets the job. Intuitively, we judge that this is not knowledge.**, **The safety condition might declare this situation as knowledge mistakenly, because in nearby worlds where they have the belief, coincidental truth remains.**
