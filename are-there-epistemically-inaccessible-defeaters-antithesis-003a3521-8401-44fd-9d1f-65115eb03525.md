## Content

**A scenario exists where person P believes a proposition Q, Q is true, and P has no way to access knowledge of an existing defeater due to epistemic limitations.**, **Intuitively, the presence of such inaccessible defeaters calls into question whether P truly has knowledge.**, **The possibility of epistemically inaccessible defeaters indicates a limitation in the defeasibility approach to ensuring knowledge.**
