## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person Laura believes it is approaching noon because she hears the church bells ring every day at that time. Unbeknownst to Laura, the bells are inaccurate except today, when they ring exactly at noon. Intuitively, we either have to say that Laura knows it is almost noon because she has justified true belief, or that she does not know because the belief-forming process is unreliable. If we say she knows, then knowledge may be unjustifiably based on unreliable processes. If we say she does not know, then justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.**
