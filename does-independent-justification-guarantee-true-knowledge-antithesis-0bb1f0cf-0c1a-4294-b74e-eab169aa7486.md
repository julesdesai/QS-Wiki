## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a weather prediction due to prior accurate forecasts by the source. Intuitively, the source could accidentally predict correctly without understanding the weather.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification requires reliable processes grounded in truth-tracking capacities, not merely past success.**, **Having independent justification from sources that are faulty lacks the necessary connection to the truth, questioning sufficiency of conditions provided.**
