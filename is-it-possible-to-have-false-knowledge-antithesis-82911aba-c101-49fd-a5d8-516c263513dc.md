## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief based on intellectual virtue, and there are no apparent defeaters, but unbeknownst to them, there are hidden errors in their reasoning. It is implausible to claim they possess true knowledge if their belief turns out to be false due to these errors.**
