## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a defective thermometer gives the correct temperature purely by accident, causing a belief in the correct temperature. Intuitively, we would judge that even with a causal connection, this does not constitute true knowledge because it is accidental.**, **Knowledge requires more than accidental correctness, suggesting the insufficiency of an accidental causal link.**
