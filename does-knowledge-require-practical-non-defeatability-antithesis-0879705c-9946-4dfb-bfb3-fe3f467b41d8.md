## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone's belief is justified and true but is theoretically defeasible in ways that are irrelevant to practical concerns. Intuitively, it seems knowledge shouldn't depend on impractical possibilities.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should withstand practical scrutiny rather than hypothetical challenges. This principle together with a strict no defeaters requirement implies impractical standards for knowledge.**
