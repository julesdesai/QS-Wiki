## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence, but the belief would have been false if slightly different conditions had been present. Intuitively, we would judge that such a belief does not qualify as knowledge despite its sensitivity.**, **A person holding a belief about the outcome of a coin flip could satisfy sensitivity, but their belief would not be seen as knowledge due to the random nature of the event.**
