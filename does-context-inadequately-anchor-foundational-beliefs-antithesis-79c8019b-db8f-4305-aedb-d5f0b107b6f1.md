## Content

**Consider a scenario in which cultural upbringing leads to foundational beliefs differing vastly between individuals, such as moral beliefs derived from varied religious traditions. In such a scenario, intuitively we would be skeptical of asserting equal foundational status for each as it complicates universal claims about knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that foundational belief should ground in some objective standard or reliability to confer knowledge. This principle, along with varying contexts leading to different beliefs being foundational, entails that epistemic context by itself cannot establish reliable foundational beliefs for knowledge.**
