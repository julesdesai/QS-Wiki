## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on reliable evidence, though the evidence is occasionally misleading. Intuitively, we would judge that the belief might not constitute knowledge due to the error possibility.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not just true belief and justification but also ruling out error possibilities. This principle suggests that knowledge demands more than just a causal connection.**
