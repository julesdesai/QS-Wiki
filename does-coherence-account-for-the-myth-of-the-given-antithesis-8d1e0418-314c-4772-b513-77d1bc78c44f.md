## Content

**Suppose a person has knowledge derived from immediate sensory experiences, which do not form part of a coherent system of beliefs. Intuitively, direct experiences should be considered knowledge despite lack of coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that immediate, non-inferential knowledge items, or 'givens', should be recognized as knowledge. This principle together with the need for coherence excludes direct experiences from knowledge.**
