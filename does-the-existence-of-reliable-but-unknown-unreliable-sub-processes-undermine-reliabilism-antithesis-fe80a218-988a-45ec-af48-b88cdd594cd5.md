## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person regularly arrives at true beliefs about the weather by relying on a weather app that is usually accurate, but unknown to them, sometimes alters forecasts based on random guesswork. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not have knowledge of the weather when the app randomly guesses correctly.**, **For a belief to be knowledge, it must be formed by a wholly reliable cognitive process without reliance on unknown unreliable sub-processes.**
