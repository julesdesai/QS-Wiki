## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a colorblind individual happens to get lucky by randomly identifying the correct color of objects in a room due to favorable lighting conditions. Intuitively, their correct beliefs do not amount to knowledge because their belief's truth is due to mere luck.**, **The Safety Condition allows for these beliefs to count as knowledge because they would not easily have been false in the given conditions, but intuitively, this does not align with our conception of knowledge.**
