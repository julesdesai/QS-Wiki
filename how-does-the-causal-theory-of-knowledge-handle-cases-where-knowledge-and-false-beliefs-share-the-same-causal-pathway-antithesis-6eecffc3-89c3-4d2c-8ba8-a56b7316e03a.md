## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes they have won the lottery because they saw a televised broadcast of the correct numbers being drawn, which indeed are the winning numbers. However, the broadcast they saw was actually a recording from a previous week, and they coincidentally won this week as well. Intuitively, it seems incorrect to say this person knows they won the lottery**, **In this case, both the true belief and a potential false belief result from the same causal pathway, questioning the sufficiency of a causal connection for knowledge**
