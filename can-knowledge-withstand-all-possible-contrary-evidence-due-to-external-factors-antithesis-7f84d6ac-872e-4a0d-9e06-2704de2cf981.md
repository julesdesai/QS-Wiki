## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is justified, but the person's belief is formed through unreliable means such as guessing. Standard intuition suggests this is not knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where justified belief persists even when presented with otherwise strong contrary evidence, solely due to manipulation of external factors. Intuitively, it seems odd to call this knowledge.**
