## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition based on a justified guess rather than the exercise of intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **It is implausible that mere true belief, even if occurring with virtuous intentions, suffices for knowledge without reliability in belief-forming processes.**
