## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition because they read it on a reliable news website, the proposition is true because of a fortunate coincidence that happened after publication, and the personâ€™s belief was thus formed by a reliable process. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition, then their belief should not be accidentally true in a way that is epistemically irrelevant. This principle together with the idea that knowledge is obtained by reliable processes means that cases of accidentally true beliefs pose a problem.**
