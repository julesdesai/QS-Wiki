## Content

**A proposition is true, and the person believes it due to a causal mechanism, such as a faulty cognitive bias leading to the belief being true by mere chance.**, **The presence of the causal mechanism does not directly support the proposition's truth in a reliable manner.**, **Intuitively, knowledge should involve more than just causal support; it should require reliability or justification.**
