## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief based on an unreliable method, like guessing. Intuitively, we judge that they do not know the belief even if it is true and they have post hoc justification. If we admit this as knowledge, it undermines the necessity of reliable methods in forming knowledge.**
