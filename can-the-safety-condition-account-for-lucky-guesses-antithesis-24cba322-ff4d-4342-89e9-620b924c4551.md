## Content

**Suppose an individual intuitively guesses the outcome of a coin flip and happens to be correct. Intuitively, we do not consider this as knowledge because the belief's truth is due to luck rather than a truth-conducive process.**, **Under the Safety Condition, their belief would not easily have been false given the situation of the coin flip, suggesting it would qualify as knowledge, which contradicts our intuitive judgment.**
