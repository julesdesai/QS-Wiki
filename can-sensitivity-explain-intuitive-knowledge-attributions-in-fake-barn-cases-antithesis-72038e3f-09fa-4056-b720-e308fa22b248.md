## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person drives through a region filled with fake barns, except for one that is real, and they visually judge that the only real barn is a barn. Intuitively, we might judge that the person knows this is a real barn.**, **In this scenario, if the proposition "This is a barn" were false, they would likely still believe it due to the convincing fakes around them, so their belief is not sensitive as required by the sensitivity condition.**
