## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition due to randomly guessing. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be based on luck. This principle together with the scenario entails that epistemic virtue is required for knowledge beyond mere true belief.**
