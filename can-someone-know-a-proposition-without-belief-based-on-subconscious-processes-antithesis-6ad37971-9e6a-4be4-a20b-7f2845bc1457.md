## Content

**There is a plausible principle that belief in a proposition can be subconscious.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person accurately and consistently performs tasks requiring knowledge of a certain fact but denies conscious belief in that fact. Intuitively, we would judge that they have knowledge even without explicit belief, suggesting that explicit conscious belief may not be necessary for knowledge.**
