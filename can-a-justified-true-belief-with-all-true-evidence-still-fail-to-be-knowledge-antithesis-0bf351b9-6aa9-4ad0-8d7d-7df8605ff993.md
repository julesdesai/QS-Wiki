## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person P has a justified true belief about the time because their watch is accurate today, even though the watch was typically wrong on previous days. Intuitively, we would judge that person P lacks knowledge despite meeting all the conditions of belief, truth, and all true evidence.**, **It is plausible that a belief formed by sheer luck or coincidence should not be considered knowledge, even if it's justified, true, and based on true evidence.**
