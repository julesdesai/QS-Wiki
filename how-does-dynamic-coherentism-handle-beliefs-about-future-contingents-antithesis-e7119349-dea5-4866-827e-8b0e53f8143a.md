## Content

**Consider a belief about a future event that fits within a dynamic belief system but turns out false due to unexpected outcomes. Intuitively, reliance on such dynamic coherence for future knowledge seems suspect.**, **There is a plausible principle that beliefs about yet-undetermined truths require more than coherence to constitute knowledge.**
