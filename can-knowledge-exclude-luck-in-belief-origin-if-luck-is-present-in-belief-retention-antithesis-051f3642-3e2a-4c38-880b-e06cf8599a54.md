**Suppose an individual forms a belief about a proposition in a non-lucky, justified manner and then temporarily forgets the evidence for the belief.**, **Later the individual re-remembers the reason without any changes to the truth or justification of the belief.**, **It appears that memory-based luck after original formation can raise questions about the preservation of knowledge status.**
