## Content

**Suppose a person believes it will rain tomorrow based on a reliable weather prediction, but unknown to them, the prediction would have been inaccurate without an unforecasted weather change. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know it will rain.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be acquired if the truth of a belief relies on accidental factors not accounted for by the reliability of the belief-forming process.**
