## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person guesses the outcome of a fair coin toss before seeing it. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the outcome or that they do not know it. If we say the person knows about this case, then we allow luck to suffice for knowledge. If we say the person does not know about this case, then sensitivity does not capture the necessary condition for knowledge because the belief is indeed sensitive**
