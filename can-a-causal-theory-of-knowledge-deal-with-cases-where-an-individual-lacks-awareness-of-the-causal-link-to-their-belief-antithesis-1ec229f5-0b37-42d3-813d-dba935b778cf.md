## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person believes there will be a thunderstorm due to having a sore knee, which always correctly predicts rain based on a medically unknown sensitivity. The individual is unaware of this causal connection between the knee pain and weather change. Intuitively, this lack of awareness challenges the sufficiency of the causal connection for knowledge**, **For cases where knowledge is asserted, it seems necessary for the believer to have some form of awareness or recognition of the causal connection for it to be considered appropriate**
