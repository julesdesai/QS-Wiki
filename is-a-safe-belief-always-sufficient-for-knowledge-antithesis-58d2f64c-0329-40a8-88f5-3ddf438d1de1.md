## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief that a bridge is safe to walk on based solely on intuition. The bridge is indeed safe in this scenario. Intuitively, we would judge that the person's belief was not formed through intellectual virtue.**, **Even though the belief was safe and true, intuitively we would judge that the belief does not count as knowledge because it was not formed through intellectual virtue.**, **Although the person's belief that the bridge is safe turned out to be true and was not easily going to be false in similar situations, it seems implausible that we should count it as knowledge without intellectual virtue being involved.**
