**Consider a case in which a person walks past a field and sees what looks like a sheep. The person believes there is a sheep in the field, but what they see is a dog disguised to look like a sheep. However, there is a real sheep out of view behind a hill.**, **In this case, the person's belief is true, but if the proposition were false, they would still believe it, due to the disguised dog. The sensitivity condition fails.**
