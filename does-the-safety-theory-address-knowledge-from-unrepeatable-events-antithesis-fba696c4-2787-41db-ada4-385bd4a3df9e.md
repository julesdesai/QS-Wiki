## Content

**Suppose we have a case where George witnesses an unrepeatable event and forms a true belief that, in any slightly different world, would not happen. Intuitively, we either have to say his belief counts as knowledge or it doesn't. If we say it doesn't, then the role of unique personal experiences in knowledge is questionable. If we say it does, then the safety requirement seems insufficient.**
