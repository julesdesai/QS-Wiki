## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition, but their belief is formed in an environment where reliable cognitive functioning is undermined by misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not truly know the proposition despite their cognitive faculties functioning properly.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition requires forming a belief based not only on proper cognitive functioning but also on an environment that supports the truth of the belief. This principle, together with the theory that proper functioning is sufficient, suggests a conflict in cases where the environment is misleading.**
