## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition.**, **It is plausible that factors outside a person's introspective awareness can affect the truth of propositions they believe. For example, environmental factors or systemic biases may influence the truth status of a belief unbeknownst to the believer.**, **Consider a scenario where a person believes they have valid introspective justification for a proposition, despite the proposition being false due to external circumstances unbeknownst to them. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks true knowledge.**
