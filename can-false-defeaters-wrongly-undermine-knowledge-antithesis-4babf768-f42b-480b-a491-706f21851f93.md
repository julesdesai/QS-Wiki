## Content

**Suppose a person has a true belief based on strong evidence, but then encounters false information that undermines their confidence in the belief. Intuitively, encountering this false information does not negate the fact that they originally had knowledge.**, **If false defeaters can cause a person to doubt their true and well-supported belief, then relying on defeasibility alone to classify knowledge overlooks the impact of false defeaters, questioning whether defeasibility is a reliable criterion for knowledge.**
