## Content

**Consider a scenario where two intellectual virtues, such as open-mindedness and intellectual confidence, lead to contradictory beliefs on the same matter. Intuitively, we are puzzled about which belief, if either, constitutes knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that uses of intellectual virtues in knowledge acquisition should not result in conflict. Any conflict questions the coherence of reliance solely on virtues.**, **If intellectual virtue conflicts lead to contradictory beliefs, then intellectual virtue alone may not definitively ensure knowledge.**
