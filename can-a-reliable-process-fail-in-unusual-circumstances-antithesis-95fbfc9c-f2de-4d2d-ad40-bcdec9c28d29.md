## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a belief using a normally reliable cognitive process, but due to an unusual and unpredictable external factor, the process leads to a false belief. Intuitively, we might say that the newly formed belief does not amount to knowledge, despite the process being generally reliable.**, **It is implausible that a reliable process should be considered reliable in scenarios of unexpected and specific failure leading to false beliefs.**
