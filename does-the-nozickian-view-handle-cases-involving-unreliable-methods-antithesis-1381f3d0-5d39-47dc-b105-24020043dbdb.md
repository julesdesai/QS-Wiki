## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at the true belief that it will rain tomorrow based on an unreliable weather prediction method that coincidentally tracks the truth across close possible worlds.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge despite satisfying the Nozickian tracking conditions because their method is unreliable.**, **A reliable belief-forming process is typically considered essential for knowledge, suggesting that tracking alone is insufficient.**
