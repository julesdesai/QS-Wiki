## Content

**Consider a case where someone knows an inductive generalization, like "All observed swans are white."**, **Inductive knowledge involves generalizing from specific instances, but the sensitivity condition implies an ability to check false instances, which is often impossible.**, **Suppose future observations might include a black swan; intuitively, this would affect sensitivity but not the status of the previous knowledge.**
