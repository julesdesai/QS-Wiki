## Content

**Imagine a person in a hall of mirrors who mistakenly believes they are seeing their friend, but it is actually a reflection. Intuitively, this is not knowledge because the belief about the friend being present is a perceptual error.**, **The Safety Condition might incorrectly count such beliefs as knowledge if the belief about seeing the friend would not easily have been false given the highly reflective environment, contradicting intuitive judgments.**
