## Content

**A personâ€™s belief could depend counterfactually on circumstances that are mistaken, yet in the actual world, the belief is true and safe from falsehood**, **For example, someone believes a stock will rise in value based on incorrect analysis, but external factors lead to the rise as predicted**, **This aligns with a safety condition because the belief remains insulated from being false, but the counterfactual dependency on mistaken circumstances makes it difficult to categorize as knowledge**
