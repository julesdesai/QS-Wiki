## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Lily receives a vague prediction about a sports event from a generally unreliable source, believing it because past experiences with unreliable sources occasionally turned true by chance. The prediction turns out to be true. Lily's belief satisfies the condition that if the prediction were false, she wouldn’t believe it, due to lack of belief in further contrary unreliable predictions. Intuitively, we do not think Lily knows the event outcome, as conditions like accuracy or reliability are missing.**, **Where sensitivity is defined as not believing a proposition if it were false, the condition may be met even in flawed belief formations similar to Lily’s case, challenging the notion of sufficiency for knowledge.**
