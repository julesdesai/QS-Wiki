## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person concludes that it rained because they see wet ground. However, the person does not know that a sprinkler system caused the wetness. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows it rained due to their belief in the ground's wetness or they must know the entire causal history.**, **It is implausible that knowing the detailed causal history is always necessary for justifying belief about events.**
