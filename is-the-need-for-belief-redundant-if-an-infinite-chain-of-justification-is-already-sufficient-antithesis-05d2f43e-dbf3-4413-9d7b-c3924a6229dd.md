## Content

**An infinite, non-repeating chain of justification is posited as a condition sufficient for the determination of knowledge.**, **If belief in the proposition is also necessary, then having an infinite chain alone isn't sufficient in practice, thus rendering the initial claim redundant.**, **This redundancy suggests a potential flaw in the sufficiency criteria when belief must still be counted as necessary.**
