## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief by a highly reliable but non-sensitive method, such as a scientific instrument that invariably outputs correct data. Intuitively, we would still attribute knowledge to the person due to the instrument's reliability, even if the person wouldn't believe otherwise in a counterfactual scenario.**, **It is implausible to insist that all reliable belief-forming processes must also satisfy sensitivity, as reliability can suffice for knowledge.**
