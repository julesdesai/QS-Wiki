## Content

**Imagine a scenario where Dana remembers reading a specific article and believes she knows its content, but the article has been falsified after she read it without her knowledge.**, **Intuitively, Dana should still know the original content she read, but not any false content added later.**, **Sensitivity theory would suggest Dana doesn't know the true original content since the belief would not differ if the original article were now false.**, **This implies a limitation of sensitivity theory in preserving knowledge derived from memory when circumstances surrounding the original information change.**
