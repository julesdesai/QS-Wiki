## Content

**Consider a scenario in which foundational scientific beliefs shift over time due to new evidence. Intuitively, knowledge based on previous foundational beliefs is now unjustified, challenging the static nature of foundational beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs should be stable over time. The change in foundational beliefs due to new evidence implies that these beliefs are not fixed, threatening the concept of unchanging foundational beliefs.**
