## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should withstand radical skepticism, meaning knowledge claims must provide reassurances against deceptive scenarios like brain-in-a-vat situations.**, **Consider a scenario in which a belief tracks truth in normal worlds but fails in radical skeptical scenarios. In such cases, intuitively, we would judge that truth-tracking cannot be the sole criterion for knowledge, as it does not address radical skepticism.**, **It is implausible that truth-tracking alone can fortify knowledge against every conceivable doubt.**
