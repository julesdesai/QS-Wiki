## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified true belief formed through the use of a reliable process, yet all available evidence suggests the belief is false. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **It is plausible that knowledge requires access to contrary evidence, which is not addressed by merely having a reliable belief-forming process.**
