## Content

**Imagine a person who discovers strong evidence for a proposition but remains in psychological doubt due to indoctrination or skepticism. Despite the evidence and implicit acceptance of the truth, the subject does not entertain a firm belief in the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the absence of significant doubt. This principle implies that a person can have true, non-accidental acceptance of truth without belief due to personal doubt, challenging the necessity of belief for knowledge.**
