## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a thermometer reading consistently gives the correct temperature in normal circumstances but is designed to show 0 degrees when malfunctioning. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that even when the reading is correct, the belief based on it may not constitute knowledge.**, **It is plausible that if a belief-forming mechanism is unreliable in certain counterfactual situations, the beliefs it produces should not count as knowledge.**
