## Content

**Imagine a writer creating a fictional world with a perfectly coherent belief system among its characters. Intuitively, we would judge that coherence in this fictional setting does not amount to real knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should correspond with external reality, not just internal coherence. This principle implies that coherence alone does not suffice for knowledge in imagined scenarios.**
