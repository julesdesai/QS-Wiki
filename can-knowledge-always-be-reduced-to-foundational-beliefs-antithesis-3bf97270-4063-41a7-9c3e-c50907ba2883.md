## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes that a particular medicine is effective based on multiple well-conducted studies. Intuitively, we would judge this to be knowledge even if the belief is not justified by self-evident or basic beliefs.**, **There is a case in which a person knows that a bridge is safe because an engineer has assessed it as safe, yet the justification relies on the trust in the engineer rather than self-evident beliefs. Intuitively, this is knowledge without foundational justification.**
