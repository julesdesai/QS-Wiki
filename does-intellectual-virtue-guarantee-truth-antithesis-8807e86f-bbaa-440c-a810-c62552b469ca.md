## Content

**It is implausible that intellectual virtue ensures truth in all cases, as virtuous processes can sometimes lead to error.**, **Suppose we have a case where intellectual virtue reliably leads to truth, but due to unusual circumstances, it results in a false belief. This would not constitute knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of truth and virtue for knowledge.**
