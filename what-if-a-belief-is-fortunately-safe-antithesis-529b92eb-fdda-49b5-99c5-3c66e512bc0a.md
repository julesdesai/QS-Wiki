## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person comes to believe the time is 10 AM based on an unreliable clock that happens to be right at that moment. The clock is unreliable in most nearby possible worlds, so the belief is luckily safe from error despite the unreliable source. Intuitively, we would judge this does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing cannot depend on luck, and this principle entails that being fortuitously correct despite unreliability does not constitute knowledge.**
