## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a student believes their professor will attend a meeting based on the professor's routine and assurance. Although everything points to the professor's attendance, unexpected events could prevent it. Intuitively, if infallible justification is required, then we might conclude the student can't know the professor will attend, making knowledge too difficult to achieve routinely.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be obtainable through ordinary means and experiences without necessitating infallible conditions that are rarely met.**
