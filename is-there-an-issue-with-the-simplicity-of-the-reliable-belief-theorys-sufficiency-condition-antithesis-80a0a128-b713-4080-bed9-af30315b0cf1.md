## Content

**The sufficiency condition as stated implies that as long as the conditions are met, knowledge is present without additional factors. Intuitively this seems too simplistic, overlooking complexities such as the knower's intentions or understanding.**, **Simplifying knowledge to a condition of reliability and truth neglects other epistemic values or cognitive processes typically involved.**
