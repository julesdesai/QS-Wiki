## Content

**There is a plausible principle that perceiving different propositions within the same context occasionally reveals more profound insights than sensitivity to one.**, **Suppose a person is sensitive to various truths within a specific domain, such as mathematics, but cannot pinpoint a correct answer right away. Intuitively, the breadth of understanding could be seen as a form of knowledge, yet it challenges if mere sensitivity to one proposition is enough.**
