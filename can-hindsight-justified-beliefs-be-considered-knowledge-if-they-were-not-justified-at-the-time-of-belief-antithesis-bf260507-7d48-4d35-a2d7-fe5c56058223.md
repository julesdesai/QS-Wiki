## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist has an untested hypothesis that eventually proves true after extensive research. Initially, the belief was true and sincerely held but unjustified until later. Despite being true and justified now, intuitively, we sense that at the time, it did not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires justification concurrent with belief. Retrospective validation challenges the immediacy necessary for true knowledge.**
