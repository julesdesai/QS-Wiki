## Content

**Consider a scenario where the standards for knowledge differ greatly from one context to another**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we could end up with the same proposition being known by one person but not another purely due to contextual differences**, **This variability suggests an inconsistency in our application of the concept of knowledge, challenging the sufficiency condition for knowledge based on contextual standards**
