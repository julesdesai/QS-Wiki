## Content

**Suppose we have a belief system where new evidence requires the revision of some beliefs to maintain overall coherence. Intuitively, we would say that the transition process from old to new beliefs affects justification.**, **It is implausible that coherence can account for the dynamic nature of belief revision, as the need to adjust beliefs indicates that coherence is not statically sufficient for justification.**
