## Content

**Coherentism involves justifying beliefs by their relation to other beliefs within the system.**, **Using one belief to justify another is a circular process, which does not ground beliefs in any stronger foundation.**, **If all beliefs require justification from within the system, there is no external anchor to ensure any belief's reliability or truth.**, **Circular justification means coherence lacks the necessary independence to validate knowledge objectively.**
