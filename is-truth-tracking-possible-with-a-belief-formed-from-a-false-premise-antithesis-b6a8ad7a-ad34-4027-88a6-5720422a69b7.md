## Content

**Imagine a case where a person believes a friend is at work because their car is not in the driveway when in fact, the friend lent their car to someone else. Intuitively, the belief doesn't track the truth, although the belief and truth align.**, **For truth tracking, the belief and truth should be connected through a reliable pathway or reasoning, which is not present when the belief is based on a false premise.**
