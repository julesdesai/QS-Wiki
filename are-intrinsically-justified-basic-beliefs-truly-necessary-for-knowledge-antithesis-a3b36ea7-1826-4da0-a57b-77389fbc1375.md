## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief coheres with a system of interconnected beliefs that all seem justified but lack intrinsically justified basic beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that this coherence is enough for knowledge without needing intrinsic justification.**, **It seems implausible that intrinsic justification is necessary for any belief in the system to contribute to knowledge, when external justification appears adequate for knowledge.**
