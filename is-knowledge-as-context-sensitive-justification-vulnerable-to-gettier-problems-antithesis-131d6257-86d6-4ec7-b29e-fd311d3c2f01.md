## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person has a justified belief that is true merely by chance, such as mistaking a fake barn for a real one while the true barn is coincidentally behind it. Here, context-sensitive justification may still lead to knowledge attribution, but intuitively, it should not be knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that genuine knowledge must be immune to luck or accidental truth, which is not adequately addressed by just contextual justification.**
