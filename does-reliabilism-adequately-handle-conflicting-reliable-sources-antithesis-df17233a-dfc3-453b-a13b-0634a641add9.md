## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person accesses two generally reliable sources providing conflicting information, leading to uncertainty. Intuitively, we either have to say that both beliefs, if chosen solely based on reliability, cannot constitute knowledge since they conflict, or neither does.**, **Both options entail that conflicting reliable sources problematize the idea of sufficient reliability for forming knowledge.**
