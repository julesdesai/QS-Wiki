## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief under extreme duress or coercion that turns out to be true, due to reliable evidence they reluctantly concede to. Intuitively, one might judge that this still constitutes knowledge despite the conditions of belief formation.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be formed even under duress if based on reliable evidence, challenging the necessity of non-luck and voluntary belief formation.**
