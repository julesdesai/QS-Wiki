## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person correctly guesses the outcome of a coin flip, thereby believing an accurate proposition through sheer chance. Intuitively, one might assert that it is not possible to know something when a belief is formed entirely by chance.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the exclusion of epistemic luck. This principle together with chance-based belief entails that the person cannot genuinely be said to know the outcome.**
