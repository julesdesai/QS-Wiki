## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person trusts a source due to manipulation or deceit, leading them to believe a true proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not genuinely know the proposition because the trust is misplaced through deceit.**, **A principle that holds knowledge must be grounded in genuine understanding and accurate appraisal of source credibility conflicts with knowledge derived from such manipulated trust.**
