## Content

**A person could have a set of beliefs that is both internally and externally coherent purely by luck.**, **If knowledge can be obtained by luck, it contradicts the need for a reliable method of establishing truth, posing a challenge to hybrid coherentism.**, **In a scenario where someone guesses the outcome of a coin flip, their belief may align with reality by luck, but it's counterintuitive to claim they have knowledge.**
