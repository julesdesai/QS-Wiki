## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person named Casey makes a correct estimation based on an intuitive grasp without any reflective process. Intuitively, we might judge that Casey knows the outcome despite the lack of introspection.**, **It is implausible that knowledge mandates a conscious, rational reflection on every belief. This suggests that intuitive understanding operating within a domain of expertise can produce knowledge without detailed conscious reflection.**
