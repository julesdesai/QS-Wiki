## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition based on intellectually virtuous reasoning, but their understanding is merely coincidental or lucky due to a misleading environment. Intuitively, we would say that this belief does not count as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires the belief to be true in a more-than-coincidental manner, even if the belief process itself is virtuous.**
