## Content

**In a scenario where two individuals are in different contexts evaluating the same proposition, one might correctly claim knowledge while the other denies it. Intuitively, this creates a contradiction, as both claims cannot be simultaneously true.**, **A plausible principle is that contradictory knowledge claims about the same proposition indicate an unstable or flawed epistemic standard.**
