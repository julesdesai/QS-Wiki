## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Jamie, forms a belief about the outcome of a dice roll based on a friend's lucky feeling, although the roll is unbiased and random. Jamie believes, with justification given the friend's track record, that the roll will result in a six, which it does. Intuitively, Jamie does not know the outcome.**, **A scenario where someone believes an outcome based on justified yet ultimately irrelevant grounds, and the belief is true but not caused by these grounds, intuitively suggests that the belief is not knowledge.**
