## Content

**Consider a case in which a person's belief A is justified by belief B and belief B is justified by belief A, forming a circular chain. Intuitively, this circular justification seems insufficient for establishing knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that circular justifications, even if coherent, do not provide genuine knowledge because they lack independent support.**
