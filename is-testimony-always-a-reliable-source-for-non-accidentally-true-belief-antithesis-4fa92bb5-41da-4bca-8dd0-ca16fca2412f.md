## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on testimony from a usually reliable source, but in this case, the source provides information based on a mere guess, unbeknownst to the believer. The belief in the proposition happens to be true, making it a non-accidentally true belief. Intuitively, this belief is not knowledge because it depends on unreliable testimony.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge obtained through testimony should come from a reliably knowledgeable source. This principle implies that the sufficiency of non-accidentally true belief for knowledge requires reliable testimonial support.**
