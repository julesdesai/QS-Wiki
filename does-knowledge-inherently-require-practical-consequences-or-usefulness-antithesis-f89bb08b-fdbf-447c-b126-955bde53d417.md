## Content

**It is implausible that knowledge must always have practical consequences or usefulness. Many mathematical truths are considered knowledge despite having no immediate practical application.**, **Consider the case of a mathematician who proves a theorem that has no known application. Intuitively, this proof is still knowledge, challenging the idea that practical consequences are necessary for knowledge.**
