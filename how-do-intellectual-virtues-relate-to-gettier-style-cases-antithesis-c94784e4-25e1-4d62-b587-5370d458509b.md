## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition because of reliable intellectual virtues, but the truth of the proposition is merely coincidental. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the belief is not knowledge, suggesting intellectual virtues may not be sufficient.**, **Suppose we have a belief that arises from an intellectual virtue, yet the belief is an instance of epistemic luck making it true. Intuitively, we must distinguish between knowledge and mere true belief, indicating intellectual virtue does not account for Gettier problems.**
