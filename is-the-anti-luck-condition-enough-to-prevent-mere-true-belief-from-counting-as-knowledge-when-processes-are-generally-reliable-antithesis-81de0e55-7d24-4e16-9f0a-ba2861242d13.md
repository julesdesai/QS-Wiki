## Content

**Consider a situation where someone believes the outcome of a dice roll because they dreamed about it the night before, and it turns out the dream was accurate. Intuitively, we judge that belief resulting from a dream does not constitute knowledge due to its accidental accuracy.**, **Even if a reliable process exists, if a belief is true only by coincidence, such as through luck in a dream, it fails the anti-luck condition for knowledge.**
