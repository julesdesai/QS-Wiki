## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows the time by looking at a reliable clock that is stopped, which occasionally displays the correct time by coincidence. Intuitively, we would judge that a belief formed by checking the time on such a clock at the exact moment it displays the correct time does not constitute knowledge because the clock is not working properly.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief should not only be true but formed through a method that wouldn't produce errors in most nearby cases. This principle suggests that insisting on belief safety as a criterion for knowledge could exclude practical cases where true beliefs are formed through normally reliable but currently malfunctioning methods.**
