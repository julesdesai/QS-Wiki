## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition because they falsely think it is verified by an expert testimony when, in fact, it is true for entirely different reasons. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that they do not. If we say the person knows the proposition, then we allow false causal beliefs to contribute to knowledge. If we say the person does not know the proposition, then merely having a causation component is insufficient for knowledge.**
