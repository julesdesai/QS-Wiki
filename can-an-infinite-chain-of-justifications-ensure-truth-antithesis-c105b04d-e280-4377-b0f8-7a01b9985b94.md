## Content

**A belief might cohere with an infinite chain of justifying beliefs without necessarily being true.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence among beliefs does not guarantee their truth, as coherent systems can be entirely detached from reality.**, **Given that coherence with an infinite chain is supposed to ensure knowledge, the conflation of coherence and truth poses an issue since coherence alone may not suffice for knowing a proposition.**
