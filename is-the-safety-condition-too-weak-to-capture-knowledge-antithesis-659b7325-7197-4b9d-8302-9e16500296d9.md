## Content

**Suppose a person watches a clock that stopped exactly twenty-four hours ago at three o'clock. Their belief that it is three o'clock and this belief is true when checked today at three again, through luck. Even in nearby situations, the belief would still be perceived as true. Intuitively, we suspect this isn't a case of knowledge since the reliability of the clock is questionable and mere luck contributes to the claim being correct.**
