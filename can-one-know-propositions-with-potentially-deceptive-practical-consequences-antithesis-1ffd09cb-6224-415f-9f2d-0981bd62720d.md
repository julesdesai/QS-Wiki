## Content

**Suppose there is a belief that certain financial practices will yield profit, and this belief is true and justified, but the practices are unethical and could lead others to harm. Intuitively, one would struggle to classify this as knowledge based on the unethical outcome.**, **There is a plausible principle that the morality or ethical nature of practical consequences may intersect with epistemic evaluation. This principle conflicts with a straightforward requirement for practical consequences in knowledge.**, **It is implausible that practical consequences, without regard to ethical considerations, should be the sole determinant in the presence of knowledge.**
