## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a coherent system of beliefs that includes a false proposition. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person cannot know the false proposition.**, **A proposition must be true for a person to know it, suggesting that coherence alone cannot account for knowledge if the proposition is false.**
