## Content

**A scenario in which a person consistently forms true beliefs through unreliable methods might intuitively lead us to judge the person lacks knowledge.**, **Reliability in belief formation is a plausible requirement for knowledge alongside truth and belief dependence.**, **Unreliable methods challenge the notion that counterfactual dependence on truth solely suffices for knowledge.**
