## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two individuals hold coherent yet contradictory belief systems due to different experiences. Intuitively, we would not judge both parties to have knowledge if their beliefs directly contradict each other.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should have an objective component not purely rooted in personal coherence, suggesting that coherence might lead to relativism and excessive subjectivity.**
