## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone forms a true belief that a particular medicine cured their illness based on coherence with their broader beliefs, yet the recovery was actually due to an entirely unrelated factor. Intuitively, this causal disconnect challenges the claim of knowing the medicine caused recovery.**, **A belief may coherently fit within a broader belief system while misconstruing causal relationships critical to genuine understanding.**, **Coherence that overlooks causal facts poses a problem for claiming that such a belief is sufficient for knowledge.**
