## Content

**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition just before an unreliable change occurs that could have made their belief false. Intuitively, the person knows the proposition despite the ease of the belief becoming false.**, **A principle that allows for knowledge to exist even when a belief could have easily been false implies a contradiction with the necessity of safety.**
