## Content

**Consider a scenario where a computer processes data and 'believes' a weather outcome, mimicking human belief processing. Intuitively, processing data alone lacks the phenomenological experience of belief.**, **It is implausible that belief without consciousness or awareness is sufficient for knowledge as it omits the subjective dimension of understanding.**, **Beliefs existing without cognitive awareness challenge the notion that non-conscious justified beliefs can constitute knowledge.**
