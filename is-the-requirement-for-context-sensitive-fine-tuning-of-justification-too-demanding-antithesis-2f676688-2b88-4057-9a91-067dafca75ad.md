## Content

**It is implausible that ordinary cases of knowing a simple fact necessitate context-sensitive fine-tuning of justification.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person justifiably believes that they have left their keys on the table and indeed they have. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know this without context-sensitive justification or claim ordinary knowledge is too demanding. If we say they know this without context-sensitive justification, then it challenges the necessity of context-sensitive fine-tuning for all knowledge.**
