## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person knows a proposition P and knows that P entails Q, but their belief does not track the truth of Q across similar situations. Intuitively, we might judge that they do not know Q.**, **A plausible principle is that if a person knows P and knows that P entails Q, then they should also know Q. This poses a challenge to the idea that knowledge as tracking accommodates such closure principles.**
