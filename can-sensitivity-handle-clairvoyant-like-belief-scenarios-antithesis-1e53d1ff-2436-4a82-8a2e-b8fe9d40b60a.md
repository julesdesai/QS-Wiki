## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person Alex believes a distant event occurred through a sudden feeling or premonition, such as an election result before hearing the result formally. Alex's belief happens to be true, and he would not have believed it if the opposite candidate had won due to lack of belief in unsuccessful premonitions. Intuitively, Alex doesn't know the result purely from a feeling, as it lacks usual reliability and evidence despite fitting the sensitivity model of not believing if false.**, **A condition of reliability or evidence may be missing in cases like Alexâ€™s, as the current sensitivity necessitation does not align with epistemic intuition about knowledge based on credible belief formation.**
