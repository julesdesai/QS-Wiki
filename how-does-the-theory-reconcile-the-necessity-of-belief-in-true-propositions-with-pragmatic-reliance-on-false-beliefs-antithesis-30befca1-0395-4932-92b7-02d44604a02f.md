## Content

**Consider a scenario where an engineer uses an outdated model that includes false assumptions but still builds a successful bridge. Intuition suggests reliance on false beliefs can lead to successful outcomes.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires belief in true propositions, but practical scenarios contradict this, showing that useful false beliefs can coexist with successful action.**, **It is implausible to assert that false beliefs always inhibit knowledge, as practical expertise often builds upon working assumptions that can be technically false yet successfully applied.**
