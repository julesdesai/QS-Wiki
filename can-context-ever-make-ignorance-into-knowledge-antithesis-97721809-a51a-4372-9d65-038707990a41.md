## Content

**Suppose a person ignorantly holds a belief due to lack of evidence, but the context mysteriously lowers the standard for knowing. Intuitively, it seems implausible that ignorance can be transformed into knowledge by context alone.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires overcoming ignorance through justification, irrespective of contextual standards.**
