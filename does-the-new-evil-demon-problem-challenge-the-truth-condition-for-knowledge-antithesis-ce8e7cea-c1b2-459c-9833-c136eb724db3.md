## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on what they think are reliable processes, the proposition appears true to them, and those processes would be reliable in other worlds, yet a deceiving demon makes the proposition false in this world. Intuitively, we would judge that the person might still know the proposition because the apparent reliability was sufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing a proposition could be affected by relevantly similar situations where truth appears but is unverifiable. This questions whether the mere truth condition is necessary if we maintain other conditions are satisfied.**
