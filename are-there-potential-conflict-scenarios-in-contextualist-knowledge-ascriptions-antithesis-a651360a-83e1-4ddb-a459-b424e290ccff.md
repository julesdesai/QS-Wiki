## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people interpret the standards of justification differently due to a misunderstanding of context. One person ascribes knowledge to another while the second rejects the knowledge claim. Intuitively, this creates conflict about the validity of the knowledge claim based solely on context interpretation.**, **A plausible principle is that consistent standards would minimize potential conflicts in knowledge ascription. This principle together with contextual standards suggests increased opportunities for conflicts due to interpretation variability.**
