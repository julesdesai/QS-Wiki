## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a single lottery ticket among hundreds of thousands and believes they will lose, which is highly probable. Intuitively, we might deny the person knows they will lose despite the high probability.**, **Given the principle of sensitivity, if the person had a winning ticket, they would still believe they would lose, suggesting that their belief is insensitive to the actual truth about the particular ticket.**
