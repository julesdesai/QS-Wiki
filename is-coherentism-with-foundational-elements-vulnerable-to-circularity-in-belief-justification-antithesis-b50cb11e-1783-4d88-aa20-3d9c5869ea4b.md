## Content

**Consider a case in which a person believes in proposition A based on belief B, and belief B is supported by proposition A, creating a circular structure. Intuitively, we either have to say that circular reasoning is acceptable in this coherent system, or that it undermines the coherence of the belief structure.**, **If we say circular reasoning is acceptable, then such reasoning can justify false or arbitrary beliefs. If we say circular reasoning undermines the system, then coherence alone cannot safeguard against circularity.**
