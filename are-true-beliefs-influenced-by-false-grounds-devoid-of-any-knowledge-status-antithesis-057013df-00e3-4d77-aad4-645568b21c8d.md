## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person holds a true belief based on predominantly true grounds, but also some false grounds. Intuitively, we must either say this invalidates knowledge or it doesn't. If it does, then it unreasonably restricts what can be known. If it doesn't, then not all grounds must be true.**
