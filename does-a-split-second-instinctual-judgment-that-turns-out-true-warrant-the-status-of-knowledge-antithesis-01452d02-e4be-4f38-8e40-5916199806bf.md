**Consider a scenario where a person makes a split-second decision that something is safe based on a gut feeling, which luckily turns out to be correct. Intuitively, such immediate judgments, even if true, often do not seem to qualify as knowledge without deliberate processing.**, **It is implausible that instinctual judgments, without deeper cognitive processing, fulfill the reliability condition necessary for genuine knowledge.**
