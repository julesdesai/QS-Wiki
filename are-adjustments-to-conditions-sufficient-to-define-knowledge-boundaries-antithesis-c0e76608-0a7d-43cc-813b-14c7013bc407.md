## Content

**Suppose a scientist forms a belief about the efficacy of a drug based on reliable empirical methods, yet unknown variables in test conditions skew the results.**, **Adjustments intended to modulate conditions can address known biases but often fall short against unknown influencing factors.**, **The view inadequately defines knowledge boundaries because not all influencing variables in belief-formation are predictable or adjustable.**
