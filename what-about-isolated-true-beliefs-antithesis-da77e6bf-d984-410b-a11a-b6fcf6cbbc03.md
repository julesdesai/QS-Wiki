## Content

**Suppose a person has a true belief about a specific fact, independently verified, but lacks a coherent body of other related beliefs. Intuitively, this person can still be said to know the fact despite isolated belief.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should accommodate true beliefs that do not cohere with a larger system of beliefs, suggesting coherence isn't always necessary.**
