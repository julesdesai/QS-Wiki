**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their justification meets context-sensitive standards**, **Causal linkages are bounded by what is contextually relevant and manageable**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their justification fits the contextually defined and causally manageable criteria**
