## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a person is exposed to an infallible, but unconscious, process that makes a particular proposition true. Intuitively, it seems that the person does not gain knowledge because they did not form a belief about the proposition.**, **A belief needs to be consciously accessible for it to count as knowledge, suggesting that mere reliability without belief formation does not suffice for knowledge.**
