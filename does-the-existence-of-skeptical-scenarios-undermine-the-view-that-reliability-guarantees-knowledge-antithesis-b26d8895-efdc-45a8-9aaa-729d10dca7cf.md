## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual is in a virtual reality indistinguishable from the real world. Intuitively, we would judge that the personâ€™s reliable processes might not yield knowledge about the real world.**, **A plausible principle is that for knowledge, one must differentiate between reality and illusions or deceptive scenarios, which reliability alone does not guarantee.**
