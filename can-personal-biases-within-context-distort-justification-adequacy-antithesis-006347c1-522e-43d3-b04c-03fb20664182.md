## Content

**Imagine a scenario where an art critic, known for a particular aesthetic taste, claims to know a painting is a masterpiece when the contextual justification standard is based on personal bias. If the context includes personal biases, the adequacy of justification is questionable.**, **It is implausible to consider knowledge claims reliable if justification standards are distorted by personal biases within the context. Such potential distortions challenge the legitimacy of context-determined justification in knowledge claims.**
