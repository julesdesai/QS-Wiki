## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario where a person inexplicably knows the future events with a high degree of accuracy. These beliefs are not based on ordinary evidence but are consistently true. If the future events were different, the person might still hold the same beliefs due to the unconventional nature of clairvoyance. Nevertheless, we often hesitate to ascribe knowledge because it does not involve typical sensitivity to evidence. Intuitively, there seems to be something unusual at play even though true beliefs are being formed.**, **There is a plausible principle that relates knowledge to justification, and while clairvoyant cases involve true belief, their insensitivity to justification raises questions about treating them as knowledge.**
