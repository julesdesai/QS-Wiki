## Content

**A person might use inductive reasoning to arrive at a belief about a particular future event based on past patterns, where the belief remains true only because those patterns persist**, **Given a possible world where these patterns change, the belief could easily become false, raising questions about its safety and reliability**, **The fact that the belief stays true in the actual world does not necessarily make it knowledge if the belief's true nature is fragile or contingent on past patterns alone**
