## Content

**Suppose there is a situation where a person's justified belief accidentally turns out to be true, such as the classic case where someone believes the time is noon based on a stopped clock. Intuitively, we might say that despite the truth, this belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **A scenario where justified true belief arises by happenstance undermines knowledge even with counterfactual dependence.**, **If accidental truths conflict with intuitive knowledge assessments, counterfactual dependence must address this discrepancy.**
