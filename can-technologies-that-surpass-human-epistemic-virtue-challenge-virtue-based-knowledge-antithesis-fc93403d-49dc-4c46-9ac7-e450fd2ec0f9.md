## Content

**Imagine a scenario where technologies, such as AI, consistently produce true beliefs more reliably than human epistemic virtues. Intuitively, this suggests that knowledge might be attainable without human epistemic virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a process, technological or otherwise, reliably produces true beliefs without requiring human virtues, then it may qualify as knowledge. This principle challenges the necessity of human epistemic virtues in defining knowledge.**
