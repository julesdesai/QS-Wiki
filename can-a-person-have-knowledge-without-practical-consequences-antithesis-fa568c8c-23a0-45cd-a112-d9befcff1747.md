## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition that is true and for which they have justification. The belief, however, lacks any practical consequences or usefulness. Intuitively, we might judge that this person still possesses knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting that the possession of knowledge does not depend on practical consequences. This principle together with the claim that knowledge has practical utility entails a contradiction.**
