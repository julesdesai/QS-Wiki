## Content

**A case in which an individual understands complex quantum mechanics theories but these theories have no immediate or foreseeable practical application does not seem to diminish their knowledge of the theories. Intuitively, understanding purely theoretical concepts still constitutes knowledge.**, **It is implausible that practical application is a necessity for knowledge if the understanding is already in place.**
