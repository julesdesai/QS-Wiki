## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief about the time based on a stopped clock, which coincidentally shows the correct time. Intuitively, although the cognitive process normally used is reliable, the belief would not count as knowledge because it is accidentally true.**, **It is implausible to categorize accidentally true beliefs as knowledge, even when arising from generally reliable processes.**
