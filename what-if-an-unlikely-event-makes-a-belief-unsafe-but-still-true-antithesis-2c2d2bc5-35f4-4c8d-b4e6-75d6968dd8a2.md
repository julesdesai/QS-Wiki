## Content

**Suppose a person makes a true prediction based on solid evidence, but an extremely unlikely event, like sabotage by an outsider, has a chance to make the prediction false. Intuitively, we would still say the person knows the truth despite the remote risk.**, **There is a belief that possibilities that are highly improbable should not undermine what we consider to be knowledge, despite potentially impacting safety.**
