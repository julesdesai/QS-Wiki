## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition because of a reliable process, but the proposition is true due to a fluke or coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **A reliable process can sometimes result in a true belief due to luck, which challenges the sufficiency condition for knowledge that necessitates a reliable process.**
