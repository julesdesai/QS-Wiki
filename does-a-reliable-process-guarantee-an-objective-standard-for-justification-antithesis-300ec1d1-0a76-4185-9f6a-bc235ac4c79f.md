## Content

**Consider a case where a person uses reliable memory from past experiences to justify a belief about a fact that has subtly changed (e.g., landmarks altered over time). Intuitively, we either have to say that they know about the current fact based on previous justification or are referencing outdated information. A reliable process can fall short of providing up-to-date justification reflecting current truths.**, **Objective standards for justification are not inherently maintained by understanding processes are reliable without consideration for context or update.**, **A reliable cognitive process needs additional dynamic adaptation to account for changes in facts to consistently justify beliefs.**
