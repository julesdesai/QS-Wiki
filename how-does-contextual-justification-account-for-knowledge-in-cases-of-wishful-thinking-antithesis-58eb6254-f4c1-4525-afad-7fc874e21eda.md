## Content

**Suppose an individual strongly believes in a proposition because it aligns with their desires, and within their social context, this belief is justified despite lacking objective support. Intuitively, we might judge that the person's belief is not genuinely knowledgeable but is instead a case of wishful thinking.**, **If contextual justification allows for instances that resemble wishful thinking to qualify as knowledge, it is implausible that contextual justification can reliably determine what constitutes knowledge.**
