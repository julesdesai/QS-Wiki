## Content

**Consider a situation where someone forms a true belief through an unreliable process but later receives consistent confirming evidence through reliable means. Intuitively, we may judge that the person comes to know the proposition genuinely.**, **The necessity of a reliable process for initial belief formation is disputed, as counterexamples suggest knowledge may arise even if initial belief formation was unreliable.**
