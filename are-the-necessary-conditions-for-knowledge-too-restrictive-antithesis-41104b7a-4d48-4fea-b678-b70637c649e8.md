## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a framework for knowledge should accommodate a broad range of true beliefs. Too restrictive necessary conditions might exclude common types of knowledge attribution in daily life.**, **Consider a scenario in which typical knowledge attributions in everyday language violate strict necessary conditions yet seem intuitively justified. This suggests overly narrow conditions might misrepresent our concept of knowledge.**
