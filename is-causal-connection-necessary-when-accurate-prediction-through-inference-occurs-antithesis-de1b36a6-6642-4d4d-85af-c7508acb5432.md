## Content

**Consider a scenario where a scientist makes a true prediction about an event through inference, without direct causal interaction with the event. Intuitively, we might judge that the scientist knows the fact about the event.**, **It is implausible that a lack of direct causation in domain-specific knowledge, like scientific predictions, undermines the presence of knowledge. This suggests causation may not be necessary if rational inference suffices.**
