## Content

**Suppose a person takes a single isolated belief that was formed through a reliable process and, without any additional check, confidently bases many further beliefs upon it. Intuitively, these derived beliefs might not seem to constitute knowledge, suggesting the initial truth and reliable formation don't suffice for conferring knowledge onto all derived beliefs.**, **When beliefs generate a series of derivative beliefs without independent checks, the sufficiency of reliability for conferring knowledge can be questioned.**
