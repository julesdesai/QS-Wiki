## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtue should reliably result in true beliefs. This principle suggests a need for further explanation when true beliefs are not reliably the outcome.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person consistently applies intellectual virtue and occasionally forms false beliefs. Intuitively, we would question whether the virtue alone is enough to account for knowing the true beliefs.**, **If intellectual virtue requires additional explanations to ensure reliable truth achievement, then reliance on virtue alone may not be self-sufficient for explaining knowledge.**
