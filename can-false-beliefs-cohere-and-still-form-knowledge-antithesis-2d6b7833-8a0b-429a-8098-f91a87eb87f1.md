## Content

**Belief systems can contain false beliefs that cohere internally and externally, yet it is problematic to assert that any knowledge could arise from false premises.**, **If coherence with false elements allows for the sufficiency of knowledge, it questions the validity of a coherentist approach that includes truth as a necessity.**, **An example is a false scientific theory that is coherent within the scientific community and practical applications, posing a challenge to the necessity of truth.**
