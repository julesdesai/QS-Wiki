## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person passively acquires a true belief through epistemic virtues without the intention to know. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person's lack of intent may question whether true knowledge has been obtained. This intuition contradicts the notion that only epistemic virtues are necessary for knowledge without considering intentionality.**
