## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, without any reliable method, guesses the outcome of a coin toss correctly, believing it would be heads, and it turns out to be heads. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not know the outcome of the coin toss, despite having a true belief.**, **It is plausible to maintain that if a belief results from a guess, it fails to qualify as knowledge, regardless of the belief being true.**
