## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief coheres with a foundational set of basic beliefs that are themselves unjustified. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is implausible that foundational beliefs without independent justification can contribute to the justification of another belief.**
