## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person knows a set of coherent propositions but rejects a logical consequence of those propositions. Intuitively, refusal to accept logical consequences denies knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle called the closure principle, stating that if a person knows P and knows P implies Q, then they should know Q. This principle together with rejection of logical consequences challenges the coherence theory.**
