## Content

**Suppose Fiona gains a true belief through credible testimony about an event she didn't witness. Intuitively, Fiona seems to have knowledge, despite the possibility of testimonial error involving epistemic luck.**, **It is implausible to fully exclude epistemic luck from testimonial knowledge, which often relies on trust and credibility. This raises questions about whether knowledge derived from testimony requires a different understanding of epistemic luck exclusion.**
