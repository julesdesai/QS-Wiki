## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, Smith, forms a belief that either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona, based on Jones's assertive testimony about owning a Ford. Unknown to Smith, Jones does not own a Ford, but coincidentally, Brown is in Barcelona. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that Smith does not know that either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona, despite having a justified true belief.**, **A justified true belief can be derived from a false premise that was believed on poor evidence, yet still end up being accidentally true. Intuitively, this does not constitute knowledge.**
