## Content

**There is a plausible principle that intellectual virtues aim toward truth. A principle is that beliefs arising from intellectual virtues should not consistently lead to falsehoods. In a case where a belief produced by intellectual virtues is false due to random chance, intuitively this challenges the sufficiency of intellectual virtues for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a belief can constitute knowledge if, although produced by intellectual virtues, it is coincidentally false. This implies a tension between the necessity of truth and the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
