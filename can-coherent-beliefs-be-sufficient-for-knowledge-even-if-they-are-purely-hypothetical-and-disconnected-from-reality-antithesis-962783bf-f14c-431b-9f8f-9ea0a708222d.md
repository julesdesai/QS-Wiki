## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a set of beliefs that are entirely coherent but not grounded in any empirical evidence or real-world observation. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **It is plausible to think that beliefs that are merely coherent but disconnected from empirical evidence do not constitute knowledge. This principle, when considered alongside the requirement for empirical grounding, challenges the sufficiency of coherence for knowledge.**
