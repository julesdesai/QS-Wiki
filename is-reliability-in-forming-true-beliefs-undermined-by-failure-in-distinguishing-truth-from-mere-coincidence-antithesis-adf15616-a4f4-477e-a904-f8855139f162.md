## Content

**Imagine someone who consistently predicts coin toss outcomes using a method based on planetary positions, incidentally proving accurate numerous times but without any real causal connection. Intuitively, we would not regard this as knowledge of the outcomes.**, **Knowledge should involve a cognitive process that reliably produces true beliefs not through coincidental or irrelevant factors but through genuine reliability linked to the truth.**
