## Content

**Consider a person who believes many propositions from reliable sources but lacks the ability to discern unreliable information and so often believes falsehoods. This gullibility impacts their overall epistemic reliability. Intuitively, such a person would not be considered to have knowledge even when a belief happens to be true.**, **A plausible principle is that reliability must be assessed globally rather than in isolated cases. A generally unreliable person may find their individual justifications undermined.**
