## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justification is necessary but not always sufficient to ensure a belief aligns with truth across nearby possible worlds. This principle, together with actual cases of justified beliefs that turn out true by accident due to misleading evidence, suggests that justification alone cannot safeguard against error in nearby worlds.**, **Consider a scenario in which a detective justifiably believes in a suspect's guilt based on strong evidence that is later found planted. Intuitively, we would judge that the detective's justified belief does not equate to knowledge.**
