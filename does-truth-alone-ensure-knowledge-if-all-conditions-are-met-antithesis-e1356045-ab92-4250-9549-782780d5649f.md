## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a true proposition, has justification, and uses a reliable process, but their justification is tenuously connected to the truth (e.g., believing it will rain because of a coincidental feeling which aligns with a later true report). Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not truly 'know' the proposition.**, **Truth is a necessary condition for knowledge, but additional ties are required between belief and truth beyond mere belief, justification, and reliability.**, **A true proposition fulfilled by all traditional conditions can still lack the coherent relationship to belief that characterizes knowledge.**
