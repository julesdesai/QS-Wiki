## Content

**Consider a system where “anti-skeptical guarantee” is defined variably by different belief systems, leading to inconsistent judgments about knowledge; intuitively, this variability undermines the reliability of knowledge claims.**, **It is implausible that such a vague requirement as an “anti-skeptical guarantee” can consistently provide an account of knowledge.**
