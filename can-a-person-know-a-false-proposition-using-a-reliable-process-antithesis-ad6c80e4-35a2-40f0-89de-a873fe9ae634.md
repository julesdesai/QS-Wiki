## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows a proposition, then the proposition must be true.**, **Consider a scenario in which a reliable cognitive process consistently produces beliefs that a specific proposition is true, yet this proposition is actually false in reality.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that a person does not know the proposition because it is false despite being believed through a reliable process.**
