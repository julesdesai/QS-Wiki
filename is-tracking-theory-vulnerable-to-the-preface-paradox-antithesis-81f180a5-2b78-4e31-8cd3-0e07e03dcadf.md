## Content

**Consider the preface paradox where an author believes every claim in their book but acknowledges one might be false. Intuitively, each individual belief could track the truth without collectively constituting knowledge.**, **It is plausible that a set of beliefs could individually satisfy tracking yet fail to satisfy coherent knowledge due to known probabilities of error.**
