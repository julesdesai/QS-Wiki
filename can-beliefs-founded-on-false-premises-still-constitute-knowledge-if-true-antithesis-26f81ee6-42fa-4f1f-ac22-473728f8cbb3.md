## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person believes in a true proposition based on reasoning from false premises. If we say the person knows the proposition, this contradicts that knowing depends on true grounds. We either say the person has knowledge through inadequate reasoning or does not.**, **Consider a scenario in which a true belief is reached solely through incorrect assumptions or flawed logic. Intuitively, attributing knowledge here seems incorrect if the person's reasoning contains crucial errors.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires correct and adequate reasoning throughout the belief-forming process. This principle would suggest beliefs based on false premises cannot yield knowledge even if the conclusion is true.**
