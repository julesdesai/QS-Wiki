## Content

**Suppose we consider various epistemic virtues, like open-mindedness and diligence. It is implausible to assert that each of these virtues in isolation always leads to knowledge. There could be situations where only a specific combination of these virtues or entirely different virtues are needed.**, **A case illustrates a person who is very diligent yet fails to achieve knowledge because diligence is not appropriately directed, thus showing that mere possession of virtues does not guarantee knowledge.**
