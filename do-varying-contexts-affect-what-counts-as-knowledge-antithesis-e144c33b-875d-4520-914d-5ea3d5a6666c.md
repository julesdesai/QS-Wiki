## Content

**Consider the scenario where a person is in a high-stakes situation, like deciding whether to go on a dangerous hike based on a weather report. In this scenario, intuitively, we judge that the person's justification for their belief needs to be stronger than in a low-stakes situation such as deciding what to wear based on the same report.**, **It is plausible that the stakes involved in a situation can affect the criteria for justification required for knowledge. This suggests that justification criteria might not be invariant across different contexts.**
