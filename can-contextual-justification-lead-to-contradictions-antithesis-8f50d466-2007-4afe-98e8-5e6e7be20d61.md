## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a belief must be consistently justified within all relevant contexts to qualify as knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a scientific hypothesis is justified within the context of current evidence but later revealed as false in a broader epistemic context. Intuitively, we would judge the hypothesis does not constitute knowledge despite its initial contextual justification.**
