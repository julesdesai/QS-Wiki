## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a reliable cognitive process functions in an environment filled with misleading evidence. Intuitively, we have to say that the person lacks knowledge despite the individual process being reliable because the unreliability of the environment undermines the perception of knowledge satisfaction.**, **It is implausible that environmental factors can override the reliability of individual cognitive processes in determining what constitutes knowledge.**
