## Content

**Consider a person with a true and safe belief that is, however, isolated within an otherwise incoherent set of beliefs. Intuitively, this isolated true belief, despite being safe, does not seem to amount to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting that coherence among one's beliefs plays a crucial role in constituting knowledge beyond mere safety and truth.**
