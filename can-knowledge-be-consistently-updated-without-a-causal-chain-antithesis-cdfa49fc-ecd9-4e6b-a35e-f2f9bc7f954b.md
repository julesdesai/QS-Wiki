## Content

**Consider a scenario in which new evidence repeatedly modifies someone's beliefs about a scientific theory through changing interpretations of past results, without a clear causal chain to the original fact. Intuitively, we accept that continuous adjustment through evidence leads to knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires a stable causal connection, as scientific knowledge often revises its theories without clear causal linkage to prior beliefs.**
