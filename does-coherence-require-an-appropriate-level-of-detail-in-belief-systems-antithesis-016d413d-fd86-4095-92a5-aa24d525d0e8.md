## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a personâ€™s beliefs are coherent but very sparse, lacking significant detail or density across various domains of knowledge. Intuitively, we would judge that mere coherence in this context does not suffice for knowledge, as it lacks the depth typically required for understanding.**, **It is implausible to suggest that coherence, without a requisite depth or richness in the network of beliefs, can provide an adequate basis for an assertion of knowledge.**
