**In a game of poker, a player confidently believes another player is bluffing based on body language cues and wins the hand with a bluff.**, **The belief was both justified and true, with no apparent defeaters, yet it seems contingent on an element of luck rather than sure knowledge.**, **This scenario implies that even non-defeated justified true belief can sometimes lack the certainty we associate with knowing.**
