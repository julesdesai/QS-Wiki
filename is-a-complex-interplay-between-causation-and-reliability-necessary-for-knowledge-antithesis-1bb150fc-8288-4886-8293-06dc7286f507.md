## Content

**There is a plausible principle that reliable cognitive processes require an appropriate causal connection to the truth of a proposition. If such a connection is absent, intuitively it questions whether true belief indeed constitutes knowledge.**, **This suggests that beyond reliability, understanding the causal story is crucial for the classification of a belief as knowledge.**
