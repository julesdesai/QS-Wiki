**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is causally connected to the fact that makes it true, or that the belief is part of a coherent system of beliefs**, **A coherent system of beliefs can provide justification for knowledge when it integrates relevant information to form a true proposition**
