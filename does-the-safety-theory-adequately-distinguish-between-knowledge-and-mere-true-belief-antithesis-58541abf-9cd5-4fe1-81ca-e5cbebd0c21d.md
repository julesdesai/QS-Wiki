**Consider a case where someone predicts the outcome of a sports event based on intuition correctly. Despite the result aligning with their belief, intuitively, it's not recognized as knowledge due to lack of evidence or reasoning.**, **Scenarios where coincidental truths, such as guessing or randomly choosing, meet theoretical safety criteria challenge distinguishing knowledge from mere belief. Intuitively, the underpinning evidence remains insufficient.**
