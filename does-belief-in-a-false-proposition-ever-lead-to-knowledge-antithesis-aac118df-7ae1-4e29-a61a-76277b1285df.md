## Content

**Consider a case where a person, Bob, believes a false proposition due to properly functioning cognitive faculties and receives knowledge incidentally through other means. Intuitively, Bob does not know the false proposition but may know some related true proposition.**, **The condition that a proposition must be true for it to be known may miss instances where people gain significant related knowledge from engaging with false beliefs.**, **Truth may not be necessary for the acquisition of other types of lesser knowledge or understanding, indicating that knowing something doesn't always require belief or the truth of the proposition itself.**
