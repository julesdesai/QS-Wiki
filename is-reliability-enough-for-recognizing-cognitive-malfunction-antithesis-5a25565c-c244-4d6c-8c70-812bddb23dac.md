## Content

**Imagine a person whose usual process of belief formation is compromised by a recent cognitive malfunction, like a stroke, yet they form a true belief during a lucid moment when their reliable processes temporarily falter. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, because the true belief arose during an atypical lapse in their process reliability.**, **True beliefs formed during aberrations in an otherwise reliable process may not constitute knowledge, questioning sufficiency of reliability.**
