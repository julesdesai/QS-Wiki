**Envision a case where investigation leads a detective to believe person X committed a theft due to strong circumstantial evidence, though unknown to the detective, person Y is also likely and indeed the real thief**, **Suppose X confesses due to unrelated reasons making the detective's belief justified and true**, **Despite a justified true belief, because the outcome involves luck rather than reliable justification, it challenges the proposal that such belief suffices for knowledge**
