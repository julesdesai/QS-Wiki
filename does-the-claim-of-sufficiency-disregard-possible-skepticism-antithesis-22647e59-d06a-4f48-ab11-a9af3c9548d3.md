## Content

**Consider a skeptical scenario in which an individual is in a simulated reality or is deceived by an evil demon, where their foundational beliefs appear justified but do not correspond to an external reality. In such a scenario, intuitively we would hesitate to attribute knowledge due only to the appearance of properly aligned beliefs.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge implies an external reality's confirmation of the belief so that when it is not possible, the sufficiency based on internal context and foundational alignment is inadequate.**
