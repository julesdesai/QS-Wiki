## Content

**Suppose a person flips a coin believing it will land on heads. Coincidentally, if heads were false, they might reverse their belief, and they do not believe it was tails. This purely happens by chance. Intuitively, a belief formed like this seems not to be knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be purely accidental or lucky, even if belief tracks truth in all relevant counterfactual situations.**
