## Content

**Consider a case where a person recalls true beliefs formed reliably in the past, but current memory processes are no longer reliable. Intuitively, we might be inclined to differentiate between initial knowledge acquisition and current knowledge maintenance under changing process reliability.**, **The reliance on reliable processes seems misplaced if previous reliability clashes with current unreliable memory states, complicating the account of continuous knowledge preservation.**
