## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief using a generally reliable but malfunctioning process and the belief happens to be true by coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can result purely from the outcome of a malfunctioning process that yields true beliefs coincidentally.**
