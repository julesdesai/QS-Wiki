## Content

**Consider a scenario where a detective believes a suspect is guilty because of intuition and circumstantial evidence that turns out to be misleading, but the suspect is guilty due to unrelated reasons. The belief remains true and seems safe in that it would not have easily been false.**, **Intuitively, we might say that the detective doesn't truly know of the suspect's guilt because the belief arose not from intellectual virtue but rather distorted evidence.**, **Even when the belief is true and safe, questionable origins like distorted evidence can challenge the assignment of knowledge.**
