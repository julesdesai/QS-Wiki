## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, through intellectual virtue and truth, forms an accurate belief but constantly doubts this belief. Intuitively, their constant doubt seems to indicate a lack of firm belief, and thus knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a stable belief that isn't undermined by persistent doubt, even if other conditions are fulfilled. This principle suggests that mere belief is insufficient without stability.**
