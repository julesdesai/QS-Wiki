## Content

**A plausible principle is that some intellectual virtues, like open-mindedness, require community engagement. A person isolated from communal intellectual virtues may still form true beliefs yet it clashes with their classification as knowledge.**, **Consider a case where an individual forms a belief in isolation, absent of diverse intellectual input. Intuitively, the absence of communal intellectual virtues questions the completeness of their knowledge.**
