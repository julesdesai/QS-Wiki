## Content

**Suppose an individual forms a belief based on sound evidence and within an environment that typically supports truth in similar instances. The sensitivity criterion requires disbelief if the proposition were false, but safety, which requires true belief in nearby possible worlds, might accord better with our judgment of knowledge. Intuitively, knowledge seems robust in safe conditions even if the belief forms a counterfactual link in contrary scenarios.**, **The plausibility of examining knowledge through the lens of safety rather than sensitivity points to a broader understanding of how beliefs remain true across close alternatives, perhaps offering a better criterion for knowledge.**
