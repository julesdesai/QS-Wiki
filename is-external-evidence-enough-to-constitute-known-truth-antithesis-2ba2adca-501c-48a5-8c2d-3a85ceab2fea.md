## Content

**Consider a situation where a person reads a true proposition on a sign in a museum. This proposition was historically accurate at its time of display but has since been revised by recent historical discoveries unknown to the person. The museum's process for keeping exhibits updated is reliable, but it failed here. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows the proposition due to this oversight.**
