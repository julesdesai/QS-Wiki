## Content

**Suppose a person sees what appears to be a hand in front of them and believes "I have a hand." Intuitively, we would judge the person knows they have a hand.**, **In considering skeptical scenarios where external reality could be manipulated, the proposition "I have a hand" could be false, yet in such cases, the person would still believe it, thus questioning the knowledge claim.**
