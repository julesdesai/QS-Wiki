**Contextualism posits that knowledge standards can change with context, potentially leading to a relativistic view of knowledge.**, **If every context can claim its own standards for knowledge, then there might be no objective standard to evaluate these claims against each other.**, **This relativistic threat could undermine the objective nature traditionally ascribed to knowledge.**
