## Content

**Suppose we have a scenario in which a person consistently receives true information from a notoriously unreliable source. Despite the source's unreliability, the information tracks truth across possible worlds. Intuitively, we may hesitate to call this knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that the reliability of the source should play a role in determining knowledge. This principle together with the sufficiency claim in tracking theory raises a potential conflict.**
