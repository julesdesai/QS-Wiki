## Content

**The Gettier problem presents cases where a person holds a justified true belief through conditions involving luck, making it unlikely that these situations are genuine instances of knowledge.**, **Suppose a person uses sound reasoning based on true premises but incorrectly deduces their conclusion due to an unrelated fluke yet still ends up with a justified true belief. Such scenarios illustrate the inadequacy of considering justified true belief as sufficient for knowledge.**
