## Content

**Suppose a person adopts an elaborately constructed but fundamentally flawed foundational belief, leading to a coherent system of beliefs built upon it. Intuitively, we would judge that this foundational error undermines any claims to knowledge despite coherence.**, **A faulty foundational premise can result in an internally coherent belief system that does not lead to knowledge.**, **It is unlikely that coherence alone ensures substantive truth in one's belief system.**
