## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief persists even when the proposition is false, then the belief is insensitive to the truth of the proposition.**, **Suppose we have a case in which someone believes it will rain because they feel joint pain, and it does rain. Intuitively, the belief would persist even if it only rained half the time they felt joint pain.**, **The belief being insensitive to the proposition's truth challenges the requirement that the belief must not exist if the proposition were false.**
