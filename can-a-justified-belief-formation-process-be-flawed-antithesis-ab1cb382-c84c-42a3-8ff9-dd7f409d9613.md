## Content

**Consider a scenario where person P forms a belief due to a random gut feeling that turns out to be true. The feeling justifies the belief in P's subjective view. Nonetheless, intuitively P does not know the proposition, as the justification is not reliably connected to the truth of the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a reliable connection between justification and truth. This principle together with P's justification suggests that P lacks knowledge despite having a justified true belief.**
