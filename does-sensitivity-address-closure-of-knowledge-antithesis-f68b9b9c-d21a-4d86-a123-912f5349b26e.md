## Content

**Closure principle suggests if you know a proposition and know it entails another, you know the second proposition. Sensitivity might fail if it disallows transferring belief to entailed propositions you cannot test directly**, **If proposition A is sensitive but its entailment, proposition B, isn't verifiable by sensitivity, it suggests sensitivity clashes with the closure principle.**
