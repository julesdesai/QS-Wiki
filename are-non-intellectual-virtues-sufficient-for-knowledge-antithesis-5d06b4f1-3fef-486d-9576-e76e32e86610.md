## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone forms a true belief through non-intellectual virtues, such as honesty or self-discipline guiding them to trust a credible source, leading to a true belief. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know the proposition or that knowledge requires intellectual virtue specifically. If we say they know, then it suggests that intellectual virtue is not always necessary. If we claim intellectual virtue is necessary, then many intuitive cases of knowledge would be excluded.**
