## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition which is justified and results from intellectual virtue, but the proposition turns out to be false. Intuitively, the person might still be counted as knowing the proposition due to their strong justification.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires truth if a person can have justified belief through intellectual virtue.**
