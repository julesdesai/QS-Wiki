## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief due to constant affirmation from an unreliable gossip network, yet, coincidentally, the belief is true and aligns with reality. Intuitively, we hesitate to label this as knowledge due to the unreliable source.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliability can be context-dependent and not all perceived reliable processes are genuinely so, challenging the sufficiency claim for knowledge.**
