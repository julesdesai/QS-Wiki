## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person, exercising intellectual virtue, arrives at a true conclusion by chance. Intuitively, this person's knowledge seems tainted by luck, suggesting that intellectual virtue doesn't exclude lucky outcomes.**, **There is a plausible principle that genuine knowledge cannot be entirely due to luck. This principle together with cases of epistemic luck complicates the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
