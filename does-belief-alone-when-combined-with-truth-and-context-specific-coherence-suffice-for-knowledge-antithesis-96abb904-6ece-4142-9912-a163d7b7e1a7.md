## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and their belief set is contextually coherent. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that they do not. If we say they know, then such knowledge seems too easily obtained.**, **Consider a scenario where a person comes to a true conclusion through dubious coherence in a highly contrived context that aligns the coherence of their beliefs. Intuitively, this seems insufficient for knowledge.**
