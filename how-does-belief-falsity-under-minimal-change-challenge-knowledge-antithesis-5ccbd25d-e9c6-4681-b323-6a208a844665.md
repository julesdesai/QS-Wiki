## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief based on extensive evidence that turns out to be true purely by coincidence, such as believing someone is in their office because their lights are on and finding it true, despite the lights being on automatically. In a slightly changed scenario, like a power outage, the belief would be false.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that the dependence of truth on a specific, fragile set of conditions undermines the claim to knowledge.**
