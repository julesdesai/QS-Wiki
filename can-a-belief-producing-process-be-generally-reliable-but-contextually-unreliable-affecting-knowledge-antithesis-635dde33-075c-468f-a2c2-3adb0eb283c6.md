## Content

**Suppose Jack uses his GPS device, which is generally reliable, to navigate to a familiar location while satellites are down unbeknownst to him.**, **The GPS falsely indicates that he arrived, forming the belief he is at his destination, which is untrue despite the usual reliability of the device.**, **This contextual unreliability means that the belief does not qualify as knowledge even if the process is reliable overall.**
