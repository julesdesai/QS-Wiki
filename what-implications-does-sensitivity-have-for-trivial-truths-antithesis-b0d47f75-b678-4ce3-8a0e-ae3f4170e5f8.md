## Content

**There is a plausible principle that awareness of trivial truths like "the sky is blue" at a particular moment should not require the sensitivity condition.**, **This principle, together with the requirement for sensitivity, entails that the person may not know trivial truths because they do not consider counterfactual scenarios.**
