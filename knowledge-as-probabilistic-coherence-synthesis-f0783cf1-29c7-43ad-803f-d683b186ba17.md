**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with a probabilistically coherent set of justified beliefs**, **Probabilistic coherence is achieved when the beliefs support one another with high probability values**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief coheres with a probabilistically coherent set of justified beliefs**
