## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an external world skeptic presents a hypothesis in which one's experiences are indistinguishable from reality, such as being in a simulation. In such a scenario, Nozick's conditions might still determine that we do not know contrary to our intuitions that we do still have knowledge of the world.**
