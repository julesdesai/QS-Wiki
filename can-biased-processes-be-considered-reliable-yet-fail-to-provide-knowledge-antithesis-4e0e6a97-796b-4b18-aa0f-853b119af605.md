## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person consistently forms true beliefs about their close friends' opinions due to strong biases while consistently making errors in other contexts. Intuitively, despite the context-dependent reliability, the biased formation suggests a lack of genuine understanding or knowledge.**, **It is implausible that such localized reliability due to bias constitutes knowledge, as biases can dramatically skew reasoning and undermine genuine understanding.**
