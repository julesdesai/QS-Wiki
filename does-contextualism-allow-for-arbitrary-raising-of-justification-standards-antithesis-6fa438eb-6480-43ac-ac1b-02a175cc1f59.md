## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone believes a true proposition with strong justification. Intuitively, raising the standards arbitrarily high in a context should not strip them of knowledge, yet contextualism suggests it might. This suggests an implausibility in standards being context-dependent.**, **It is implausible that merely conversational changes can affect whether a belief qualifies as knowledge, which contextualism permits.**
