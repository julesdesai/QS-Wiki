## Content

**Suppose there is a case where a person forms a belief through a reliable cognitive process, the belief itself is true, yet the person is not aware of the process's reliability or the factors that make it reliable.**, **Intuitively, we would judge that a person lacking awareness of their belief's epistemic grounding might not truly have knowledge, even if all conditions of reliability and truth are met.**
