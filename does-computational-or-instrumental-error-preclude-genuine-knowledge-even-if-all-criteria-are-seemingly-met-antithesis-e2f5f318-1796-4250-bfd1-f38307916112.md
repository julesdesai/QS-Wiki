## Content

**Imagine an engineer calculates a bridge's safety using a faulty calculator, but the bridge ultimately stands securely. The belief in safety is true, justified by prior assessments, and no false lemmas exist. Intuitively, reliance on instrumental error suggests that genuine knowledge is lacking.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge relies on accurate and reliable tools or methods. Instrumental fallibility challenges the integrity of justified beliefs, questioning them as knowledge.**
