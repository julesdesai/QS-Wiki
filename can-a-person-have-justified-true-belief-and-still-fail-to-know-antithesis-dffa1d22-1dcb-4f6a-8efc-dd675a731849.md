## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person P believes a lottery ticket will lose because each ticket has a very low likelihood of winning. Intuitively, this belief is true and justified. However, if the ticket does indeed lose, many people would judge that P still does not know it will lose.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing requires more than just having a true belief that is justified by statistical likelihood. This principle together with P's belief entails that P lacks knowledge even if the belief is justified and true.**
