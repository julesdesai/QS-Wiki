## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a deep conviction in a belief, but this conviction is based on inadequate reasons, such as mere tradition or authority. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows the belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that conviction alone cannot convert belief into knowledge unless supported by adequate reasons. This principle entails that adequate reasons must underpin belief for it to be knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which an individual believes a truthful proposition simply due to societal conditioning, not on any reasoned examination. Intuitively, we do not attribute knowledge to the individual.**
