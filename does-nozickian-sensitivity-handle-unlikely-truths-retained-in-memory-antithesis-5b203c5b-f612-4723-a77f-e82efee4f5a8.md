## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person knew a rare historical fact, they remember it accurately, but the fact is so obscure that it is unlikely they would still believe it if they found out more general information about related matters. Intuitively, we would judge that the continued belief is fragile because it is not sensitive to typical informational updates.**, **The sensitivity condition for knowledge suggests that one should not believe the proposition if it were false. This principle together with memory retention may fail when the context or frequency of encountering new information is low.**, **Cases of rare and unusual facts where belief is retained through memory challenge the robustness of the sensitivity condition when memory is involved.**
