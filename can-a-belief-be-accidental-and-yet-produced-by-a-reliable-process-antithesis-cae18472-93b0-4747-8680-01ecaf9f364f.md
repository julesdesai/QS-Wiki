## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief that their friend is at home because they always are at this time, based on numerous past experiences, which constitute a reliable cognitive process. However, the friend has just left, and the person mistakenly continues to believe they are at home by habit. Intuitively, this results in a belief that does not amount to knowledge despite arising from a reliable process.**, **It is implausible that the mere repetition of reliable processes alone suffices for knowledge when specific individual instances are erroneous or accidental.**
