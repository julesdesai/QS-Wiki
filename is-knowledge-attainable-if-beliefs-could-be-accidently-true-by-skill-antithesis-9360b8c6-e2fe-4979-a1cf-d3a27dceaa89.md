## Content

**A case occurs in which a person skilfully forms a belief through intellectual virtue, such as a skilled archer hitting a target by chance. Intuitively, it does not seem that the person knows they will hit the target.**, **Even if the belief comes from intellectual competence, the accidental nature of the target being hit suggests the beliefâ€™s truth is lucky.**, **This implies that just the presence of intellectual virtue is not enough to rule out the luckiness of true belief.**
