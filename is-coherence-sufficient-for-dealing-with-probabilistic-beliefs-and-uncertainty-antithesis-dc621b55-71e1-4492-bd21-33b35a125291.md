## Content

**Coherentism may struggle with probabilistic beliefs when certainty is lacking**, **Consider a belief system where beliefs are probabilistic and may not fully cohere due to inherent uncertainties**, **One could argue that knowledge needs a more robust mechanism than coherence to handle such uncertainty**
