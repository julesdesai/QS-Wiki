## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person uses an unreliable method to form a belief, such as consulting a horoscope, but the resulting belief turns out to be true. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that reliability of the method used to form a belief is essential for knowledge. This principle, together with the safety condition, may suggest that mere truth coupled with safety is insufficient for knowledge.**
