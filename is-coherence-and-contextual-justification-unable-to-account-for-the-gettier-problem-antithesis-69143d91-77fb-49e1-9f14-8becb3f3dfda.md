## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person has a justified belief that coheres with their system of beliefs and the context, but due to an intervening factor, the belief is true only by luck; such a case is reminiscent of Gettier scenarios, suggesting coherence and contextual justification might not suffice for knowledge.**, **A case where a person's belief matches the truth by accident, despite being coherent and contextually justified, presents a challenge similar to the Gettier problem, indicating a possible gap in the theory.**
