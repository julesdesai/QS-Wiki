## Content

**Suppose we have a case where one of two individuals predicts the outcome of an event based on comprehensive information and data, while the other predicts the outcome based on a causal hunch. Intuitively, when the prediction is true, the one with comprehensive information possesses knowledge due to coherent justification more than causal intuition alone.**
