## Content

**Consider mathematical propositions believed through pure reasoning and proofs without a causal connection to a physical fact. With such beliefs, we intuitively judge they constitute knowledge regardless.**, **In the case of abstract entities, the notion of a causal connection seems inapplicable, challenging the sufficiency of such a connection for knowing abstract propositions.**
