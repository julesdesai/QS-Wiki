## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's beliefs about the world are coherent and foundational but are all based on an elaborate deception such as a virtual reality simulation. Intuitively, we would judge that their beliefs do not amount to knowledge.**, **A belief that coheres with foundational beliefs could still be false if the foundational beliefs are systematically misleading.**
