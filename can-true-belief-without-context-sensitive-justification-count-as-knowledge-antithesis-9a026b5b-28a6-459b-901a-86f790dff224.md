## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a lottery ticket holder believes they will lose, and their belief is true. Intuitively, we would not say they have knowledge, even if justification based on context suggests they are justified.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than true belief and context-sensitive justification alone. This principle, together with the acceptance of context-sensitive justification, suggests that true belief may not amount to knowledge.**
