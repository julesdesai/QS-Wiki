## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should have an objective standard applicable across contexts. This principle together with context-dependent standards of justification entails that knowledge claims may become too relativistic.**, **Consider a scenario where two individuals have the same evidence and true belief but are in different contexts. Intuitively, one could know while the other does not, which suggests a problematic relativity in the concept of knowledge.**
