## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a child holds a true belief due to testimony, a cognitive process not involving intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we would still attribute knowledge to the child.**, **It is implausible that intellectual virtue is necessary for knowledge, as many acceptances, especially from testimony, bypass individual intellectual competence yet count as knowledge.**
