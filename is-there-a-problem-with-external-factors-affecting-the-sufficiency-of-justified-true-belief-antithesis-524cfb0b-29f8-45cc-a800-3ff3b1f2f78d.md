**Consider a situation where a person is in a room with two identical paintings and believes the one directly viewed is a genuine artwork based on a reliable catalog description that applies only to one painting**, **Suppose the painting directly viewed by the person is indeed genuine and the belief is justified and true**, **Intuitively, since the catalog company erroneously describes both paintings identically, the person seems not to have knowledge due to an external factor that affects what counts as proper justification**
