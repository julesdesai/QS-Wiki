## Content

**Imagine a philosopher, Tom, who holds a philosophical belief that coincidentally is true but doesnâ€™t rely on any specific performance or methodology to reach the belief.**, **In this case, intuition might suggest that Tom's belief counts as knowledge even though it lacks an apt mental performance.**, **This raises questions about whether the necessity of apt mental performance for knowledge could be overstated in some instances.**
