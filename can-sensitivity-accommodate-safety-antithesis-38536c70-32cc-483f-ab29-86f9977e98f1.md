## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition based on reliable evidence. Intuitively, we would judge this to be a case of knowledge.**, **Suppose further that in nearby possible worlds where the person barely avoids error, the false proposition would be believed. Intuitively, our judgment of knowledge is threatened in scenarios where a person could easily have been wrong.**
