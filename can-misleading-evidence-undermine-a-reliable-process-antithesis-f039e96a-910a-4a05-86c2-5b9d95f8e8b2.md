**Relying solely on a reliable process, misleading evidence can still result in a false belief that is mistaken as knowledge, especially if the process doesn't detect the mislead.**, **Suppose we have a case where a reliable process is exposed to intentionally misleading data. Intuitively, we either must say the resulting belief qualifies as knowledge, which seems wrong, or it doesnâ€™t, which means reliability isn't enough.**
