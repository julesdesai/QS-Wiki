## Content

**Suppose someone knows an insignificant truth, such as the number of grass blades in a random field. Intuitively, we question the value of this knowledge when it serves no practical purpose.**, **It is implausible to claim that knowledge of trivial truths independently holds intrinsic value when it lacks any consequence in practice.**
