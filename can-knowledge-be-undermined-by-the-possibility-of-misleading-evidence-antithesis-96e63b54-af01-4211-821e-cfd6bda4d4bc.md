## Content

**Suppose a person knows P based on reliable evidence, but there exists a misleading piece of evidence which, if encountered, would lead them to believe not-P. Intuitively, the existence of such evidence should not affect their current knowledge claim, raising doubts about the sensitivity condition.**, **Intuitively, knowledge should remain stable despite possible misleading evidence affecting hypothetical beliefs. This raises questions about whether sensitivity accounts for all knowledge adequately.**
