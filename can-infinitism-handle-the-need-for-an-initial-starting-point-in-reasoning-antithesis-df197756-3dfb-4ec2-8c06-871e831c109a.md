## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition and provides reasons for the belief. Intuitively, we might find an issue if no initial foundational reason is given, as reasoning typically originates from some accepted starting point.**, **There is a plausible principle that sound reasoning often starts from a foundation or a base of certain beliefs. This principle together with the requirement of an infinite chain without a starting point suggests a gap or issue in justifying beliefs under infinitism.**
