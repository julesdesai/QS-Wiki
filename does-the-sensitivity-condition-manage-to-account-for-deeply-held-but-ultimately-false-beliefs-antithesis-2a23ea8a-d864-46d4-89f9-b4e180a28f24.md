## Content

**Suppose an individual holds a deeply entrenched false belief due to cultural indoctrination or strong psychological bias. Intuitively, they persist in such belief even when presented with potential falsity, questioning the sensitivity principle.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge involves open-mindedness to reject false propositions, but individuals with entrenched beliefs often lack this trait, thereby challenging the scope of sensitivity.**, **Entrenched beliefs, resistant to falsehood counterfactuals, highlight a weakness in the sensitivity condition, as genuine knowledge seems to involve more reevaluation flexibility.**
