## Content

**Consider a scenario where a trained meteorologist predicts rain due to reliable weather patterns but there's also a local folklore predicting rain that day, making the belief part of the folklore unreliable but accidentally true. Intuitively, it challenges whether the belief arises strictly from the reliable process.**, **Although the meteorologist holds a true belief from a reliable process, context introduces overlaps that might undermine the entire basis being solely reliable.**
