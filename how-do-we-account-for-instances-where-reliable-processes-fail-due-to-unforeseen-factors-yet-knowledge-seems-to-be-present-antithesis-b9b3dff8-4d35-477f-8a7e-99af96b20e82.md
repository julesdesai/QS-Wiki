## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person uses a normally reliable weather app to check if it will rain, but unknown to them the app is currently malfunctioning. Intuitively, if they still correctly believe it will rain due to unrelated factors, one might argue they still possess knowledge.**, **It is implausible that only the reliability of the belief-forming process, without considering unforeseen situations, is always linked with knowledge, as intuitions suggest knowledge can still occur under such circumstances.**
