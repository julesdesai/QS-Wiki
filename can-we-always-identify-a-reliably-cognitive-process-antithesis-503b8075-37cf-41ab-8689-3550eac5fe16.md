## Content

**It is implausible that we can always accurately identify whether a cognitive process is truly reliable without evaluating its long-term track record across various situations.**, **Consider a scenario where a person claims a cognitive process is reliable based on limited evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the process might not be reliable if tested more thoroughly.**
