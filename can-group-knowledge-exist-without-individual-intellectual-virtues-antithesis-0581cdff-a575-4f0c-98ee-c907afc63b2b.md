## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a research team discovers a cure due to collaborative inputs, including those from less knowledgeable team members that are not based on intellectual virtue. Intuitively, the team as a group is perceived to have knowledge of the cure. If we imply each must individually possess intellectual virtue, it denies group knowledge unless all members are virtuous.**, **It is implausible that group knowledge is reducible to individual members' virtues only, as collaborative contexts often show knowledge as an emergent property.**
