## Content

**Consider the notion of justification and the idea that what counts as justified belief may vary widely between contexts. In such variabilities, intuitively, there is no clear line where a belief transitions from being justified to unjustified due to context-dependent criteria.**, **A vague standard for justification caused by contextual differences makes it implausible for it to serve as a reliable condition for determining knowledge.**
