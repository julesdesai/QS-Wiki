## Content

**Imagine a scenario where cultural or contextual differences result in mutually incoherent belief systems each claiming knowledge; this raised concern over whether contextual justification allows for objective knowledge.**, **Consider a situation in which one context justifies a belief while another equally valid context rejects it; intuitively, such relativism seems to undermine the notion of universal knowledge.**
