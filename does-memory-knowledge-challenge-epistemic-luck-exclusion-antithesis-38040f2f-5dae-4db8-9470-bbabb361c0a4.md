## Content

**Imagine Irene recalls a true fact from the past, but her memory was unreliable at the time of encoding, making the true recall seem fortuitous. Intuitively, her recalled belief does not resemble knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge from memory requires more than just the exclusion of epistemic luck at the time of recall. This suggests that epistemic history affects knowledge claims.**
