## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person randomly selects a lottery number and, against all odds, wins. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that this coincidental accuracy does not constitute knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than mere truth and beliefâ€”it requires reliability in the method of arriving at belief. This principle suggests coincidental truth does not equate to knowledge.**
