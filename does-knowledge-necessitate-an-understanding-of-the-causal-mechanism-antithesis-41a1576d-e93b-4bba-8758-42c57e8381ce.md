## Content

**Suppose a case in which a person believes a fact about quantum mechanics without understanding the causal mechanisms described by it. Intuitively, the lack of comprehension seems to suggest that knowledge requires understanding, not just causal connection.**, **It is implausible to claim that causality alone suffices without the individual's understanding of the causal mechanism.**
